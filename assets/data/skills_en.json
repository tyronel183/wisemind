It combines both the <strong>emotional mind</strong> and the <strong>rational mind</strong> so that you can act calmly and thoughtfully.</p>\n\n<h3>How to tell which state you are in</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Emotional mind:</strong> decisions driven by feelings, impulsive actions.</li>\n  <li><strong>Rational mind:</strong> logic without emotions, coldness, detachment.</li>\n  <li><strong>Wise mind:</strong> balance, clarity, calm understanding of the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Why this skill matters</h3>\n<p>Wise Mind helps you maintain inner balance and make decisions that are aligned with your goals. It is especially helpful in conflicts, during anxiety, or when you face difficult choices.</p>\n\n<h3>How to practice</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Pause and take a few deep breaths.</li>\n  <li>Notice what you feel and what you are thinking about.</li>\n  <li>Name both states: “My emotion says one thing, my mind says another.”</li>\n  <li>Ask yourself: “What is my Wise Mind telling me?”</li>\n  <li>Choose a calm and considered action.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p><em>Situation:</em> someone close to you says something hurtful.<br>\nEmotional mind: “I don’t want to talk to them anymore!”<br>\nRational mind: “We need to discuss this calmly.”<br>\nWise mind: “I need some time to calm down, and then I’ll talk about it.”</p>\n\n<h3>Common mistakes</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Looking for a perfect answer.</li>\n  <li>Trying to “think out” Wise Mind instead of feeling it.</li>\n  <li>Mistaking Wise Mind for suppressing emotions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>How to strengthen the skill</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Practice short pauses before making decisions.</li>\n  <li>Notice which “mind” you are acting from in different situations.</li>\n  <li>Use breathing practices to restore balance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The main idea</h3>\n<p>Wise Mind is not about being perfect, but about an inner point of balance between feelings and facts. It appears when you stop fighting with yourself and start listening to both voices — emotion and reason.</p>",
        "fullPractice": "<h2>🧘 How to Practice Wise Mind</h2>\n\n<p>Wise Mind practice helps connect the rational and emotional states of mind. This skill develops through regular attention to your breathing, body, and inner center. Start with simple exercises in a calm environment, when you feel safe.</p>\n\n<h3>🌿 1. Stone in the lake</h3>\n<p>Imagine yourself as a small stone falling into a clear lake. Feel how you slowly sink down through calm blue water. When you reach the bottom, focus on the feeling of quiet and stillness inside. Notice the clarity of the water, its depth and stillness. Feel your inner center and rest your attention there.</p>\n\n<h3>🌀 2. Spiral staircase</h3>\n<p>Imagine that inside you there is a spiral staircase leading downward — to your inner center. Go down slowly, with each inhale moving deeper into yourself. Notice your sensations. You can stop if you want, pause, or “turn on the light”. When you reach a state of inner calm, hold your attention in the center — maybe in your stomach area or solar plexus.</p>\n\n<h3>💨 3. Breathing with the phrase “Wise Mind”</h3>\n<p>On the inhale gently repeat to yourself the word “Wise”, on the exhale — “Mind”. Focus fully on these words and on your breathing. Continue until you feel calm and inner balance.</p>\n\n<h3>💭 4. Question to Wise Mind</h3>\n<p>On the inhale ask yourself silently: “What is my Wise Mind suggesting?” On the exhale simply listen. Do not try to invent an answer — let it appear naturally. Sometimes the answer comes not as words, but as a feeling or an image. If there is no answer — that is okay, try again later.</p>\n\n<h3>❓ 5. Check: is this Wise Mind?</h3>\n<p>When you are making a decision or planning an action, ask yourself: “Is this decision coming from Wise Mind?” Take a breath, ask the question, and on the exhale listen to your inner response. Do not analyze — just observe. If there is no answer, return to your breath and try again later.</p>\n\n<h3>🌬 6. Breathing through the center</h3>\n<p>Focus on your breathing. As you inhale, feel the air in your body. Allow your attention to sink into your center — perhaps in the solar plexus area or between your eyebrows. Feel steadiness and gentle presence there. On the exhale, keep your attention in this center.</p>\n\n<h3>🌈 7. Expanding awareness</h3>\n<p>As you inhale, keep your attention in your center. As you exhale, stay in this state but gently expand your awareness to the whole space around you: the room, sounds, sensations. Feel yourself as part of the present moment.</p>\n\n<h3>🫁 8. Pauses between inhale and exhale</h3>\n<p>Notice the brief pauses between inhale and exhale. In these pauses you may feel a special quiet. Let yourself “fall” into these moments of stillness, noticing the inner space without movement and thoughts.</p>\n\n<h3>🧘 9. A simple way to turn on Wise Mind in daily life</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>When you feel stressed — pause and take a couple of deep breaths.</li>\n  <li>Notice what you are feeling and thinking.</li>\n  <li>Ask yourself: “What is my Wise Mind suggesting right now?”</li>\n  <li>Choose an action that will help you, not harm you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> practice Wise Mind not only in crisis, but also in everyday moments. Then the skill will become natural and will be available when you really need it.</p>"

Take a few breaths.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Notice <strong>three sounds</strong> around you.</li>\n  <li>Notice <strong>two bodily sensations</strong> — for example, breathing, pressure, temperature.</li>\n  <li>Note <strong>one thought</strong> that is present right now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do not judge or analyze. Just register the fact: “sound”, “sensation”, “thought”. This is a simple training in presence.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Practice “Contemplating an object”</h3>\n<p>Take a small object in your hands — a stone, cup, leaf, or pencil.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Look at it carefully: color, shape, texture, light and shadow.</li>\n  <li>Touch the surface, feel the temperature and texture.</li>\n  <li>Put the object down, close your eyes, and take a breath in and out.</li>\n  <li>Open your eyes and look again as if you are seeing it for the first time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This practice develops attention to detail and “present moment vision”.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Practice of observing the breath</h3>\n<p>Focus on your breathing. Feel the movement of air — inhale, pause, exhale.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Follow the movement of your belly and chest.</li>\n  <li>Notice the pauses between inhale and exhale.</li>\n  <li>Notice the sensations in your nostrils as the air goes in and out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your mind gets distracted — gently bring it back to the breath. Noticing distraction is already observation.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Practice “Thoughts as clouds”</h3>\n<p>Close your eyes and imagine that your mind is the sky and your thoughts are clouds. They appear and drift away on their own.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Notice: “A thought came” and “A thought left”.</li>\n  <li>Let them move without holding them and without analyzing.</li>\n  <li>If you want to “jump into a thought”, simply observe this urge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This way you learn to be an observer rather than a participant in the inner stream.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💡 More ideas for practice</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Watch clouds in the sky, noticing their shape and movement.</li>\n  <li>Listen to the silence between sounds or to pauses in speech.</li>\n  <li>During a walk, notice details of nature: colors, lines, textures.</li>\n  <li>Observe smells and tastes — inhale the aroma of coffee, feel the texture of food.</li>\n  <li>Notice bodily sensations while walking: the contact of your feet with the ground, movement of your shoulders, breathing.</li>\n  <li>Notice thoughts and feelings as “coming and going” — don’t fight them, just observe.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> observe every day, even for one minute.

        "fullInfo": "<h2>✍️ Skill “Description”</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong> is the ability to put what is happening into words: your thoughts, emotions, actions, and the events around you. It is the next step after observation — when you do not just notice, but also <em>describe</em> what you notice.</p>\n\n<p>When you call things by their names, you stop being completely taken over by an emotion or a thought. Between “I feel” and “I am this feeling” a space appears. And in this space you can choose how to act.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🎯 Why this skill is needed</h3>\n\n<p>Description helps translate inner experience into clear words. This reduces confusion, anxiety, and impulsivity. When you can describe, you understand yourself better and give others a chance to understand you.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Clarifies what you feel and think, without guesswork.</li>\n  <li>Reduces the intensity of emotions because you turn the experience into a conscious form.</li>\n  <li>Helps you speak with others clearly and calmly.</li>\n  <li>Develops self-reflection and inner stability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In DBT, the “Description” skill is used to make the inner — outer, and the unconscious — conscious. It is not analysis, not explanation, and not evaluation. It is simply an accurate statement of fact: <em>“I feel sadness”, “I notice tension”, “I have the thought that…”</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧩 Principles of description</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Call things by their names.</strong> Say simply: “This is anxiety”, “This is anger”, “This is tension”.</li>\n  <li><strong>Speak in facts, not evaluations.</strong> Instead of “I feel terribly bad”, try: “I feel heaviness in my body and sadness”.</li>\n  <li><strong>Use present-tense language.</strong> “I notice”, “I feel”, “I am thinking right now…” helps you stay in the moment.</li>\n  <li><strong>Separate observation from interpretation.</strong> The difference between “He is angry at me” and “He raised his voice” — this is mindfulness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When you learn to describe without interpreting, you stop being a victim of your thoughts. It is a step toward clarity and freedom.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧠 How it works</h3>\n\n<p>Emotions and thoughts often get mixed up in the mind. When you describe them, they become more tangible. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“I feel anxious” → turns into → “I feel my heart beating faster, tension in my stomach, and thoughts that I might make a mistake.”</li>\n  <li>“I am angry” → turns into → “I feel heat in my body, clenched fists, and the thought: ‘He is being unfair to me.’”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This does not invalidate the emotion — on the contrary, it helps you understand what exactly is happening and reduces inner chaos.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 Examples of descriptions</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“I notice that I am speaking quickly and loudly right now.”</li>\n  <li>“I feel slight nervousness before the meeting.”</li>\n  <li>“I think that I want to be alone and rest.”</li>\n  <li>“I see my shoulders lifting when I get tense.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>📘 How to develop the Description skill</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>From time to time, notice what you feel and put it into words: “I feel…”, “I think…”, “I notice…”.</li>\n  <li>When you experience a strong emotion — describe it. Do not try to change it, just name it.</li>\n  <li>Use descriptions in everyday life: “I am walking down the street”, “I am pouring tea”, “I am listening to music”.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>The main point:</strong> the “Description” skill is a way to get your clarity back.

        "fullInfo": "<h2>🌊 Skill: “Urge Surfing”</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Urge surfing</strong> is the ability to notice strong impulses, cravings, or urges (to eat, text someone, drink, lash out, distract yourself) and to withstand them without acting immediately. You learn to “ride” the wave of emotion or urge without merging with it and without trying to stop it.</p>\n\n<p>Urges and impulses are like waves: they <strong>rise, reach a peak, and fall</strong>. When you observe them instead of acting automatically, you keep your choice. This skill teaches you to be free from impulses — not through rigid control, but through awareness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🎯 Why this skill matters</h3>\n\n<p>We all face moments of strong desire — to eat something “forbidden”, to answer sharply, to do something impulsive. If you give in, it may feel easier for a second, but worse in the long run. Urge surfing helps break this cycle.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Reduces impulsive actions and relapses.</li>\n  <li>Helps you stay in contact with yourself when emotions are intense.</li>\n  <li>Teaches you to notice physical and emotional signals of craving.</li>\n  <li>Builds resilience and patience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This skill is especially helpful for addictions, binge eating, self-harm, anger, and procrastination — any situation where you “really want to” do something you later regret.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧠 How urge surfing works</h3>\n\n<p>When you become aware of an urge, it loses some of its power. Most impulses last only a few minutes if you simply observe them instead of feeding them with thoughts like “I can’t stand this” or “this is wrong”.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of fighting, you move into the role of observer. You notice sensations in the body, your breathing, and the movement of the wave inside. Over time, body and mind learn that an urge is just a state that comes and goes.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💡 Core principles</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Don’t fight the wave.</strong> Any attempt to “suppress” it usually makes the urge stronger.</li>\n  <li><strong>Don’t feed it with thoughts.</strong> Label: “thought about the urge”, “thought about acting” — and gently return to breathing.</li>\n  <li><strong>Notice the body.</strong> Where is the craving felt? Chest? Stomach? Hands?</li>\n  <li><strong>Remember:</strong> every wave eventually goes down. It doesn’t need your help — you just need to stay on the board.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each time you “ride out the wave”, you strengthen the neural pathway for self-regulation — your brain learns that it is possible to wait without acting.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🪞 Examples from daily life</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>You feel like eating something when you are not hungry. Instead of going straight to the kitchen, you pause and notice: “This is an urge. It’s in my stomach as tension.” After 2–3 minutes, the intensity goes down.</li>\n  <li>You want to send an impulsive message. You take a breath, notice your heart racing, and tell yourself: “I can wait 10 minutes.” The wave passes — and now you can choose consciously.</li>\n  <li>You feel anger. Instead of shouting, you notice heat in your chest, your breathing, tension in your hands. You breathe and observe. The energy leaves on its own.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>⚖️ What to keep in mind</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>An urge is not an action.

Then in a hard moment, the body will remember how to “stay balanced”.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Main idea:</strong> urge surfing is not a fight but observation. You learn that even the strongest impulses are temporary. Each wave you ride out builds confidence: you can be stronger than the impulse simply by staying present.</p>",
        "fullPractice": "<h2>🌊 Practices for the “Urge Surfing” Skill</h2>\n\n<p>These practices help you notice strong impulses — to act, eat, use substances, start a conflict — and move through them without self-destruction. You do not fight the wave, do not run away, and do not give in — you learn to <strong>stay on the board</strong> until the wave goes down on its own.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>1. Practice: “Notice the wave”</h3>\n<p><strong>Step 1 — Recognize the urge.</strong> When you feel a strong craving or impulse, name it: “Here is a wave of urge.”</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Note what exactly you are drawn to: food, phone, alcohol, conversation, action.</li>\n  <li>Acknowledge: “This is just an urge, it is not the same as an action.”</li>\n  <li>Let go of the struggle — the goal is not to “get rid of it”, but to observe it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2 — Notice the body.</strong> Where in your body do you feel the wave? Tension? Warmth? Tightness? Movement?</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Describe it silently: “Warmth in my chest”, “tension in my stomach”, “pulse speeding up”.</li>\n  <li>Do not judge the sensations — simply watch how they change.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>2. Practice: “Breathe through the wave”</h3>\n<p>Take several slow breaths in and out. Imagine that you are breathing <strong>through the area of the body</strong> where you feel the urge.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>On the inhale — notice the tension.</li>\n  <li>On the exhale — release resistance.</li>\n  <li>Allow the wave to move — don’t hold it and don’t speed it up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With each breath, gently remind yourself: “The wave is rising… and it will fall.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>3. Practice: “The wave as an ocean”</h3>\n<p>Imagine you are standing on a surfboard in the middle of the ocean. The turbulence is your urge. It rises, gains strength, and then slowly goes down.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>You keep your balance — you do not fall, do not fight, just move together with the wave.</li>\n  <li>You watch it from the side: it is energy, not an enemy.</li>\n  <li>With time the wave goes away, and the water becomes calm again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can close your eyes and mentally “surf” the feeling, noticing how it naturally passes.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>4. Practice: “10-minute timer”</h3>\n<p>When the urge feels unbearable, set a timer for 10 minutes. Promise yourself: <strong>“I will just wait and see what happens.”</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Sit comfortably, breathe, observe your body.</li>\n  <li>Each minute note what is changing in your sensations and thoughts.</li>\n  <li>After the timer, ask yourself: “What is happening with the wave now?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In most cases the intensity has already decreased. Even if not — you have proved to yourself that you can endure.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>5. Practice: “Name and allow”</h3>\n<p>Every time an impulse appears, tell yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“Here is an urge… it is here.”</li>\n  <li>“I allow it to be.”</li>\n  <li>“I do not have to act on it.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These short phrases help shift focus from reacting to observing. You stop being captured by the emotion and come back to yourself.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6. Practice: “Track the wave cycle”</h3>\n<p>When the impulse passes, note for yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>How did it start?</li>\n  <li>Where was the peak?</li>\n  <li>How long did the wave last?</li>\n  <li>What helped you stay on the board?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This exercise builds confidence: waves always pass, and you can ride them again.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💡 More practice ideas</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Notice small impulses during the day: the urge to scroll your phone, interrupt, argue — and practice surfing there.</li>\n  <li>Use your breath as an anchor in any wave — bodily, emotional, or behavioral.</li>\n  <li>Combine surfing with non-judgment: instead of “I’m failing again”, say “Here is an urge, and I’m here with it.”</li>\n  <li>After each wave you ride out, acknowledge your success, even if it was only 30 seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> the essence of surfing is not to defeat the waves, but to stay on the board. You do not control the ocean, but you do control your attention — and that is what gives you freedom.</p>"

I’ll feel better right now!\"</li>\n  <li>🧘 The voice of wise mind answers: \"Yes, it hurts. And I don’t want things to be worse tomorrow.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Try to write a short inner dialogue between these two voices.  \nLet them \"argue\", and then choose a phrase that helps you stay in balance.</p>\n\n<p><em>Example:</em>  \n\"I want to run away — but I can just breathe and stay.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>4️⃣ Exercise \"Play it forward to the consequences\"</h3>\n\n<p>When you hesitate between acting and holding back, ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>What will things look like in 5 minutes if I do this?</li>\n  <li>What will things look like in 5 hours?</li>\n  <li>What will things look like in 5 days?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The answers often show that <em>what feels like a solution right now will become new pain tomorrow</em>.  \nThis shift in time helps you regain control.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>5️⃣ Practice \"Wise list of consequences\"</h3>\n\n<p>Create a standing list of consequences for yourself — the ones you’ve already experienced.  \nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>After impulsive actions I feel guilty.</li>\n  <li>After holding back I feel proud and calmer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Put this list somewhere visible.  \nWhen an impulse hits — just read it.  \nRemembering past outcomes helps you make more mature decisions in the present.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6️⃣ Exercise \"Physical pause\"</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes the mind doesn’t switch on right away. Then use the body:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Take a deep breath in and out.</li>\n  <li>Drop your shoulders, open your hands.</li>\n  <li>Say out loud: <em>\"Pause. Think.\"</em></li>\n  <li>Then take your Pros and Cons sheet.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This way you create a bodily anchor for awareness — and lower the chance of automatic action.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>7️⃣ Practice \"Training in calm moments\"</h3>\n\n<p>Choose small everyday situations —  \nfor example, \"buy sweets or not\", \"answer sharply or calmly\".  \nEach time, quickly go through the Pros and Cons scheme.</p>\n\n<p>This way your brain learns to do this check automatically, even in strong emotions.  \nThis is the goal of DBT — for the skill to switch on by itself when you need it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>8️⃣ Practice \"Support in a crisis\"</h3>\n\n<p>When emotions are too strong, ask someone you trust to help you walk through the Pros and Cons out loud:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Ask them not to give advice, but simply to ask questions, like:</li>\n  <li>\"What’s good about this decision?\"</li>\n  <li>\"What could go wrong?\"</li>\n  <li>\"How will you feel tomorrow?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This external dialogue helps you stay in wise mind when it’s hard to do it alone.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>9️⃣ Practice \"After the action\"</h3>\n\n<p>If you still made an impulsive move — don’t punish yourself.  \nTake the same Pros and Cons template and fill it in <em>after the fact</em>:  \nwhat was on the \"pros\" side, what was on the \"cons\" side, what do I feel now.  \nThis turns a \"mistake\" into experience and reduces the chance of repeating it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🔟 Reflection \"I chose consciously\"</h3>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, write down:  </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>When did I make a conscious choice today?</li>\n  <li>What helped me pause?</li>\n  <li>What do I want to try next time?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This simple practice strengthens the sense of control and confidence:  \n<em>\"I can choose.\"</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong>  \nThe Pros and Cons skill works only when you give yourself time to think.  \nSometimes this sheet is the only thing standing between impulse and awareness.</p>"

What do you feel in your body? What thoughts are coming up? What is happening around you?\nThis step shifts attention from emotion to observation — from reacting to awareness.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“I feel tension in my chest.”</li>\n  <li>“The thoughts are: ‘He’s being unfair.’”</li>\n  <li>“My hands are clenched, my breathing is fast.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You simply register the facts.

        "fullInfo": "<h2>💧 The TIP skill</h2>\n\n<p><strong>TIP</strong> is a set of physiological techniques that help quickly reduce the intensity of emotions when you feel like a wave is about to crash over you.\nIt is a tool for emergency situations when logic doesn’t work and the body is overloaded with stress.</p>\n\n<p>The abbreviation stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>T — Temperature</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>I — Intense exercise</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>P — Paced breathing & Paired muscle relaxation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🎯 Why this skill is needed</h3>\n\n<p>When emotions become too strong, the body goes into “fight, flight, or freeze” mode.\nHeart rate and breathing speed up, muscles tense, awareness narrows —\nIn this state, it is almost impossible to think rationally or make considered decisions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TIP helps “reset” your physiology,</strong> bringing the body back to a more normal level of arousal and, in turn, calming the mind.\nYou are not trying to “think positively” — you are changing your physical state, and the emotion naturally decreases.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧠 How it works</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Temperature (T)</strong> activates the so-called “diving reflex” — an ancient physiological mechanism that slows heart rate and reduces nervous system arousal.</li>\n  <li><strong>Intense exercise (I)</strong> burns off excess adrenaline, helping the body exit the “fight or flight” state.</li>\n  <li><strong>Paced breathing and relaxation (P)</strong> activate the parasympathetic nervous system — the system of rest and recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All three components together quickly reduce emotional and physical tension.\nThis skill is especially helpful for anxiety, panic, anger, urges, or severe stress-related fatigue.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💡 When to use TIP</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>When emotions are so strong that you feel like you’re about to “explode”.</li>\n  <li>When you want to break something, say too much, run away, drink, or “switch off”.</li>\n  <li>When anxiety or panic are felt physically in the body — rapid heartbeat, heat, tightness, sweating.</li>\n  <li>When you’re stuck in the cycle “strong feeling → impulsive action → regret”.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>TIP is not a replacement for reflection or conversation. It is first aid to restore access to your thinking and other DBT skills.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🪞 Real-life examples</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>You’ve had an argument with someone close and feel intense anger.<br>\n  You go to the bathroom, splash your face with cold water, and breathe slowly. Two minutes later your heart is beating more calmly — now you can talk more clearly.</li>\n\n  <li>Before an important meeting you feel panic building.<br>\n  You do 20 squats and 5 slow breaths. Your body relaxes, anxiety decreases, and your focus clears.</li>\n\n  <li>You want to “act out” or “eat away the stress”.<br>\n  You do several rounds of 4–6 breathing and feel the wave of urge subside. Now you can decide what to do next.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>⚙️ Principles of using TIP</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Act quickly.</strong> TIP is a “here and now” skill — don’t wait until the emotion becomes unbearable.</li>\n  <li><strong>Work with the body, not the thoughts.</strong> Don’t analyze — just perform the physical actions.</li>\n  <li><strong>Don’t expect a magic effect.</strong> Sometimes the body needs a few minutes to shift.</li>\n  <li><strong>Practice ahead of time.</strong> The more you train in calm periods, the faster the skill works in a crisis.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🚫 Common mistakes</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Skipping the “Temperature” step — without cooling, the body may stay in high arousal.</li>\n  <li>Exercising too hard or too long — 1–2 minutes of active movement are enough.</li>\n  <li>Breathing too fast — this increases anxiety. Make sure the exhale is longer than the inhale.</li>\n  <li>Waiting for “perfect calm” — the goal is not to make the emotion disappear, but to be able to think clearly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>The main point:</strong> TIP is an emergency stabilization skill.\nIt doesn’t solve the problem itself, but it gives you back the ability to address it consciously.\nYou don’t have to be perfect — it’s enough to take the first step: cool the body, move, breathe, and relax. That already works.</p>",

everything anew, without your usual labels.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>When it helps:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>🩵 <em>With anxiety</em> — watch stable, static objects (walls, furniture, the horizon).</li>\n  <li>🖤 <em>With sadness</em> — look at light, nature, faces, colors.</li>\n  <li>❤️ <em>With anger</em> — focus on soft lines and calming colors (green, blue, grey).</li>\n  <li>🤍 <em>With emptiness</em> — find something visually alive: fire, water, people moving, light reflections.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>👂 Hearing — “Listen to the world”</h3>\n\n<p><strong>How to

<li>Choose something small and eat it slowly, noticing taste, temperature, and texture.</li>\n  <li>Drink water, tea, or coffee mindfully — noticing how the liquid touches your tongue, throat, and body.</li>\n  <li>If you don’t feel like eating, you can simply suck on a mint, a slice of lemon, or a candy — the key is attention to the sensation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>When it helps:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>🩵 <em>With anxiety</em> — neutral tastes (water, herbal tea, simple food).</li>\n  <li>🖤 <em>With sadness</em> — tastes associated with warmth and home.</li>\n  <li>❤️ <em>With anger</em> — cooling or refreshing tastes (mint, citrus, ice).</li>\n  <li>🤍 <em>With emptiness</em> — bright, vivid tastes (fruit, spices, sour or spicy foods).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🤲 Touch — “Feel the borders of your body”</h3>\n\n<p><strong>How to practice:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Hug yourself and feel the pressure of your arms and the warmth.</li>\n  <li>Touch fabric, rough surfaces, fur, wood, metal.</li>\n  <li>Take a shower, sit on the floor, feel the support beneath your body.</li>\n  <li>Wear soft clothes, wrap yourself in a blanket if you need a sense of safety.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>When it helps:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>🩵 <em>With anxiety</em> — steady, warm sensations: holding a mug, feeling a blanket, hugging.</li>\n  <li>🖤 <em>With sadness</em> — soft, cozy textures: wool, leather, fur, warmth.</li>\n  <li>❤️ <em>With anger</em> — cool, firm materials and contrasting sensations: cold water, pebbles, metal.</li>\n  <li>🤍 <em>With emptiness</em> — tactile movement: stroking an animal, rubbing your palms, feeling your body.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💡 Combined practice</h3>\n\n<p>Try using several senses at once:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Look at a candle (sight), breathe in its scent (smell), feel the warmth of a mug in your hands (touch).</li>\n  <li>Drink tea while listening to music and watching the light outside the window.</li>\n  <li>Go for a walk: notice the air on your skin, the sounds, the smells, the steps under your feet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These practices are especially helpful when your emotions feel vague or when you feel empty.<br>\nCombining sensations restores a sense of wholeness and presence in your body.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🪞 Creating your own “sensory kit”</h3>\n\n<p>Create a small kit of items that help you calm down:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A small candle, essential oil, soft fabric, a photo, a stone, headphones, a tea bag.</li>\n  <li>Keep the kit somewhere easy to reach in a stressful moment — as a reminder that you have ways to help yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> the “5 Senses” skill is not about “enjoyment”, it’s about “being here”.<br>\nEach sensation

It is a gentle way to stay with yourself until the storm calms down.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧩 Step-by-step breakdown</h3>\n\n<h4>1️⃣ I — Imagery</h4>\n<p><strong>Essence:</strong> use the power of imagination to create images that bring you peace and a sense of safety.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Imagine yourself on a beach, in a warm room, or in the arms of someone you trust.</li>\n  <li>Visualize your body filling with soft light or warmth, and the emotion leaving with each exhale.</li>\n  <li>You can picture yourself going through this difficulty with dignity and calm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Example:</em> you are nervous before a conversation — you imagine standing on solid ground, your breathing steady, your voice stable.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>2️⃣ M — Meaning</h4>\n<p><strong>Essence:</strong> try to find meaning or value in what is happening.  \nEven if the situation is painful, there can be growth, learning, or a chance to show resilience or kindness.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Ask yourself: “What is this teaching me right now?”</li>\n  <li>Remember: “How might I use this experience to support others?”</li>\n  <li>Sometimes the meaning is simply to endure the moment without falling apart.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Example:</em> you feel lonely but notice you are learning to stay in contact with yourself, not only with others.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>3️⃣ P — Prayer (inner plea or spiritual connection)</h4>\n<p><strong>Essence:</strong> turn toward something greater than yourself — nature, life, strength, inner wisdom, God, the universe, or simply a sense of calm inside.  \nIt doesn’t have to be religious — what matters is the felt sense of support.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Silently say: “May I find peace.” “May this pass.” “May I have the strength to get through this.”</li>\n  <li>You can place a hand on your heart and repeat: “I am here. I’m holding on.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Example:</em> in panic, you close your eyes, place your hand on your chest, and say: “May I feel safe.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>4️⃣ R — Relaxation</h4>\n<p><strong>Essence:</strong> use any methods that help your body release tension and restore a sense of calm.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Breathe slowly — inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 6.</li>\n  <li>Tense and relax your muscles, stretch, or take a warm shower.</li>\n  <li>Sit comfortably, feel the support under your body, notice your breathing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the body relaxes, emotions soften and your mind becomes clearer.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em> you are anxious before a call — you take three deep breaths, feel your shoulders drop, and your voice becomes steadier.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>5️⃣ O — One thing in the moment</h4>\n<p><strong>Essence:</strong> focus on only one thing — what is happening right now.  \nYou do not have to solve everything at once. Just stay with the current moment.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Do one activity: wash a cup and feel the water, or walk and feel your steps.</li>\n  <li>If your thoughts drift away, gently bring your attention back to the process you’re in.</li>\n  <li>Tell yourself: “Right now I’m just doing this.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Example:</em> you are distressed about a conflict, but in this moment you are simply pouring tea and feeling its warmth and smell — nothing else.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>6️⃣ V — Vacation (a short break)</h4>\n<p><strong>Essence:</strong> take a brief “mental vacation” — even for a few minutes.  \nStep out of the situation for a short while to restore your energy.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Go for a short walk, take a break from your phone, change your surroundings.</li>\n  <li>Give yourself a mini-break: close your eyes, turn on music, look out the window.</li>\n  <li>If you can’t physically leave, find an inner sense of rest: exhale, pause, a few moments of silence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Example:</em> things are heated at work — you step out onto the balcony, breathe the air, and look at the sky for 3 minutes. You return with a clearer head.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>7️⃣ E — Encouragement</h4>\n<p><strong>Essence:</strong> speak to yourself in a supportive, not critical, way.  \nThis is not about “perfect affirmations” but about gentle reminders that you are doing what you can, and that is enough.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Phrases: “I’m coping as best I can.” “I’m taking it step by step.” “This is hard, and I’m still going.”</li>\n  <li>Imagine you are comforting a friend — and say the same words to yourself.</li>\n  <li>Support can also be physical — placing a hand on your shoulder, straightening your back, taking a deep breath.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Example:</em> after a mistake, you say: “I’m human, and I’m learning. I’m allowed to make mistakes.” — and feel the tension ease.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🪞 How to apply IMPROVE</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Choose one or two letters — you don’t need to use everything at once.</li>\n  <li>Use the skill as a “pause” between the emotion and your next action.</li>\n  <li>IMPROVE is not about fixing the situation but about support. It’s a way to get through without breaking.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> you can’t always make life easy, but you can make a moment softer.  \nIMPROVE helps you find grounding even in pain — through presence, meaning, and kindness toward yourself.</p>",

        "fullInfo": "<h2>⚖️ The “Radical Acceptance” Skill</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Radical acceptance</strong> is a full, conscious acknowledgment of reality as it is.  \nNo “but”, no “it shouldn’t be this way”, no resistance.  \nIt is not approval and not resignation — it is recognizing the fact: <em>“This has already happened.”</em></p>\n\n<p>When you stop fighting what you cannot change, the pain becomes just pain — without extra suffering.  \nYou regain the ability to see clearly and to choose what to do next.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🎯 Why this skill is needed</h3>\n\n<p>Most suffering comes not from pain itself but from <strong>resistance</strong> — the mental “no” to what already is.  \nWe get angry because reality didn’t match our expectations.  \nWe get stuck because we don’t want to acknowledge the fact.  \nWe lose energy arguing with what cannot be changed.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Acceptance does not make pain pleasant — it makes it <strong>bearable</strong>.</li>\n  <li>It opens the way to action — because you start working with what is, not with the fantasy of “how it should be”.</li>\n  <li>Through acceptance, inner peace can appear — even in the middle of chaos.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧠 What “radical” means</h3>\n\n<p>The word “radical” (from Latin <em>radix</em> — root) means “to the very root”.  \nIt’s not a superficial “fine, I’ll put up with it”, but a <strong>deep bodily and emotional acknowledgment of the fact</strong>.  \nYou accept not only with your mind, but with your body, your breathing, your facial expression, your posture.</p>\n\n<p>Radical acceptance does not mean you agree with what happened.  \nIt is the recognition: <em>“Yes, this happened. I am in pain. I wish it were different — but this is already here.”</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>⚖️ The difference between acceptance and submission</h3>\n\n<p>🕊 <strong>Acceptance</strong> is clarity.  \nYou see reality as it is and stop spending energy on denial.</p>\n\n<p>⛓ <strong>Submission</strong> is hopelessness.  \nYou abandon yourself and stop believing that anything matters.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Acceptance</th><th>Submission</th>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>“This happened, and I choose how to live on.”</td><td>“This happened, and nothing matters anymore.”</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Active participation in life.</td><td>Passive resignation.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Freedom from struggle.</td><td>Giving up hope.</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Acceptance is strength, not weakness.</strong> It returns the energy that used to go into resistance.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🪞 Examples from life</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>You lost your job. You can be angry, argue with it, blame others — or you can acknowledge: “Yes, this happened.” Only after that can you look for a new solution.</li>\n  <li>A relationship ended. You don’t have to be glad about it, but you can say: “I’m in pain, and this is part of life.”</li>\n  <li>You made a mistake. Acceptance sounds like: “I did what I did. I can learn and move on.”</li>\n  <li>Something unfair happened. Acceptance does not mean agreement, but it frees you from powerless rage: “This happened, and now I choose how to respond.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💡 When to use this skill</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>When you’re stuck in thoughts like “it shouldn’t have happened this way”.</li>\n  <li>When you keep going back to the past, replaying “what if…”.</li>\n  <li>When you feel strong resistance or inner protest.</li>\n  <li>When pain doesn’t go away because you keep arguing with the fact.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧩 How to notice that you are resisting</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Thoughts like “Why me?”, “It shouldn’t be like this”, “This is unfair”.</li>\n  <li>A sense of inner tension, tightness, anger, a wish to “undo” what happened.</li>\n  <li>Attempts to replay the past or force others to change what has already happened.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Acceptance starts with noticing resistance.  \nSometimes the first step is simply to say: “I see that I don’t want to accept this.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 What radical acceptance sounds like</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“I acknowledge that this happened.”</li>\n  <li>“I am in pain, and I still choose to live.”</li>\n  <li>“I don’t have to approve of this to stop suffering.”</li>\n  <li>“This is a fact.

This is how it is. And I am still here.”</em></p>",
        "fullPractice": "<h2>⚖️ Practices for the “Radical Acceptance” Skill</h2>\n\n<p>Radical acceptance is a practice, not a single decision.  \nIt has to be repeated again and again: every time the mind starts arguing with reality.  \nThese exercises help you develop the skill step by step — through noticing, consciously “turning the mind”, and bodily letting go.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>1️⃣ Notice the resistance</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Where to start:</strong> you cannot accept what you do not notice.  \nThe first step is to see where exactly you are telling life “no”.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Notice thoughts like: “This is wrong”, “It shouldn’t have been this way”, “I can’t stand this.”</li>\n  <li>Feel your body: where is the tension, clenching, resistance?</li>\n  <li>Name it: “Here is my resistance.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You don’t have to let it go right away. Simply noticing is already the beginning of acceptance.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>2️⃣ The “Turning the Mind” Practice</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Essence:</strong> when you catch yourself in an inner “no”, you gently bring yourself back to “yes”.  \nThis is not forcing yourself — it is choosing to turn toward reality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step by step:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Notice that you are resisting (“I don’t want this to be true”).</li>\n  <li>Gently say to yourself: “I choose to turn toward reality.”</li>\n  <li>If your mind goes back to “no”, repeat again. Turning the mind might be needed many times a day.</li>\n  <li>Each turn is a small act of freedom. Even if acceptance lasts only 3 seconds — that is already practice.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Phrase for turning:</strong>  \n<em>“I cannot change what has already happened. I can only choose how to be with it.”</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>3️⃣ Acceptance through the body</h3>\n\n<p>The body often resists even more strongly than the mind.  \nThis practice helps you bring in the physical dimension of acceptance.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Sit or stand comfortably. Notice where in your body you feel the struggle — chest, jaw, stomach, shoulders.</li>\n  <li>Take a deep breath and on the exhale say to yourself: “This is how it is.”</li>\n  <li>If the body tightens — don’t force it to relax. Just observe and breathe.</li>\n  <li>Gradually notice how the resistance softens a little.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can add a gentle acceptance gesture: palms facing up, open shoulders, a slight half-smile — classic DBT “physiological markers” of acceptance.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>4️⃣ Acceptance statements</h3>\n\n<p>Say them out loud or silently when you notice pain, irritation, or inner protest.  \nThey are not magic — but through repetition they create a new relationship with reality.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“This is a fact.”</li>\n  <li>“I don’t like it, but it has already happened.”</li>\n  <li>“Resistance only makes it more painful for me.”</li>\n  <li>“I can be with this.”</li>\n  <li>“May I find peace even if it hurts.”</li>\n  <li>“I didn’t choose this, but I choose how I will live from here.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Important: these statements don’t have to sound like “convincing yourself”. Let them be simple statements of fact.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>5️⃣ “Acceptance on the inhale and exhale” Practice</h3>\n\n<p>A simple breathing exercise that connects mind and body.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On the inhale — become aware of the pain, the fact, the reality (“Yes, this is so.”).</li>\n  <li>On the exhale — allow the resistance to soften a little (“And I can be with it.”).</li>\n  <li>Don’t force anything — just breathe and observe the process.</li>\n  <li>If thoughts of protest return — start again from the first step.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6️⃣ When acceptance feels impossible</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes resistance is huge and it feels like accepting is impossible.  \nThis is normal. Radical acceptance is not “all or nothing”. It is a gradual process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can help:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Acknowledge the pain. Tell yourself: “This is hard.”</li>\n  <li>Remember that you do not have to “like” what you are accepting.</li>\n  <li>Keep in mind: acceptance ≠ approval. You are only stopping the fight with the past.</li>\n  <li>Sometimes it is enough to accept that you are <strong>not ready</strong> to accept yet — and that is already a step.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>7️⃣ Working with beliefs that block acceptance</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether any of these beliefs are holding you back:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“If I accept it, it means I agree with it.”</li>\n  <li>“Acceptance is weakness.”</li>\n  <li>“If I stop being angry, everything will stay unpunished.”</li>\n  <li>“I don’t deserve peace.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All of these thoughts are part of resistance.  \nGently replace them with more realistic ones:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“Acceptance does not mean agreement.”</li>\n  <li>“I can be strong and calm at the same time.”</li>\n  <li>“My peace does not cancel justice.”</li>\n  <li>“I deserve peace even if the situation is unfair.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>8️⃣ Symbolic practice: “Letter to reality”</h3>\n\n<p>Write a short letter to reality — as if you were speaking to it directly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nDear reality,  \nI don’t like what you’ve done. I’m angry, I’m tired, I wish it were different.  \nBut I understand: you are what you are.  \nAnd I choose to stay with you without running away.  \n— Me\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This method helps you acknowledge the fact and release the struggle through a symbolic action.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💡 Tips for everyday practice</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Each day notice at least one small “no” that you can turn into a “yes”.</li>\n  <li>Train the body: a half-smile, open palms, soft breathing — this is the “posture of acceptance”.</li>\n  <li>Find an inner “witness” — the part of you that simply observes without judging.</li>\n  <li>Don’t expect instant relief: sometimes acceptance comes slowly, layer by layer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Radical acceptance is not one big “yes”.  \nIt is hundreds of small “yes” said to life every day.  \nSometimes quietly. Sometimes through tears. But each one gives you back some strength.</p>"

        "fullInfo": "<h2>🙂 The “Half-Smile and Open Hands” Skill</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Half-smile and open hands</strong> is a bodily practice that helps you enter a state of acceptance and reduce inner resistance.  \nIt is based on the principle of feedback between body and emotions: <strong>by changing your facial expression and posture, you influence how you feel</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This skill is not about a “fake smile” or “pretending everything is fine”.  \nIt is a way to send a gentle physiological signal to the brain: “The danger has passed; it’s safe to relax.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧠 Why it works</h3>\n\n<p>Emotions and the body are inseparable. When you’re angry, your body tightens; when you’re anxious, muscles tense; when you’re sad, your shoulders slump, your face freezes.  \nBut the feedback works both ways: <strong>if you change your posture, your muscles send a signal to the brain that things are safer</strong>, and the level of stress decreases.</p>\n\n<p>The half-smile activates brain regions associated with calm and trust.  \nOpen palms (or “willing hands”) reduce tension and create an inner sense of openness.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of the simplest yet most powerful bodily ways to soothe emotions, especially when words don’t help.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>⚖️ The meaning of the skill</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Half-smile</strong> is a sign of inner agreement: “Yes, this is how it is. I see reality.” It does not mean “I like it”; it means “I am not fighting it right now.”</li>\n  <li><strong>Open hands</strong> are a symbol of willingness: “I am open to experience.” It’s not about “giving up” but about “stopping the clenching”.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This posture shifts you from the mode of “fight and defense” into the mode of “perception and stability”.  \nYou are not suppressing the emotion — you are allowing yourself to be with it without fighting.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💡 How it feels</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The muscles of the face relax, breathing becomes freer.</li>\n  <li>Tension in the chest, abdomen, and shoulders eases.</li>\n  <li>Thoughts become less sharp, more space appears inside.</li>\n  <li>The emotion remains, but it stops controlling you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🪞 Examples from life</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>You are about to explode — but instead you straighten your shoulders, open your palms, and take on a gentle half-smile. The emotion doesn’t vanish, but it stops dictating your behavior.</li>\n  <li>Before an important conversation — you sit upright, palms up, exhale. Anxiety decreases, your body feels more grounded.</li>\n  <li>In sadness — palms up, half-smile, breathing. After a minute a quiet sense of support appears: “I’m still here.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>📘 When to use it</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>When you are resisting something that has already happened.</li>\n  <li>When the emotion is strong but you cannot act right now.</li>\n  <li>When you need to restore balance — before a conversation, a conflict, or sleep.</li>\n  <li>With anger, anxiety, sadness, fatigue.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>⚙️ Physiology of the skill</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Half-smile</strong> activates the vagus nerve — the system of rest and safety.</li>\n  <li><strong>Open hands</strong> reduce activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the “fight or flight” response.</li>\n  <li>1–2 minutes of practice are often enough for the body to get the “safety” signal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🚫 Common mistakes</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Forcing a wide, fake “smile” — this creates tension rather than calm.</li>\n  <li>Expecting instant results — sometimes it takes time.</li>\n  <li>Using the practice to suppress emotions — the goal is different: to allow your feelings to be there without fighting them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Sometimes the body can accept reality more easily than the mind.

Mindfulness is not silence, it’s your attitude toward the noise.</li>\n  <li>Use a metaphor: “Thoughts are like a radio. I can listen, but I don’t have to believe.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Mindfulness of thoughts is not a fight for “right” thoughts.  \nIt’s the ability to see any thought as a passing guest — to greet it and then let it go in peace.</p>"

What’s under that?”</li>\n  <li>Using an “emotion vocabulary” — expanding your word set for feelings.</li>\n  <li>Noting how emotions change throughout the day.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sometimes it’s enough to simply say: “There is anger in me right now.”  \nThat already is an act of awareness and acceptance.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🪞 Signs that you’ve identified an emotion accurately</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The description is short and specific (“I’m angry”, “I’m sad”), not vague (“I feel bad”).</li>\n  <li>You feel slight relief or clarity after naming it.</li>\n  <li>Your behavior becomes less impulsive — a space for choice appears.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 Example formulations</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“I feel anxious because I don’t know what will happen next.”</li>\n  <li>“I’m angry because my boundaries were crossed.”</li>\n  <li>“I’m sad because I lost something important.”</li>\n  <li>“I feel guilty because I acted against my values.”</li>\n  <li>“I feel joy because I’m with people I trust.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧘 When this skill is especially useful</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>When emotions are intense and you don’t understand why.</li>\n  <li>When you feel “numb” or “switched off”.</li>\n  <li>When you get irritated easily or cry “for no reason”.</li>\n  <li>When you want to act but don’t understand what’s happening inside.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Emotions are not enemies but navigators.  \nThe better you recognize them, the more accurately you understand where to go.</p>",

(shame about sadness, anger at fear, etc.)</li>\n  <li>If yes — name both: “Anger 7/10 <em>and</em> fear 5/10.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6️⃣ “Face–Voice–Posture”: entering through expression</h3>\n<p><strong>When to use:</strong> hard to catch feelings from the inside.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Face: what is your facial expression now?

My body: <strong>[2 signals]</strong>. Impulse: <strong>[action]</strong>.”</em></p>\n<p>If the sentence is concrete and clear — you’ve identified the emotion precisely enough for further work.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧰 If “I feel nothing”</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Check PLEASE factors: sleep, food, substances, illness, load.</li>\n  <li>Start with the body: 2 sensations + 4/6 breathing for 1 minute.</li>\n  <li>Ask: “If this were a feeling, what could it be?” — and take the first word that comes, without arguing.</li>\n  <li>Name at least “neutral/numb” and rate 0–10 — that’s also a state.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🚫 Common traps and how to avoid them</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Mixing thoughts and feelings:</strong> replace “I feel that…” with “A thought came to me that… I feel…”</li>\n  <li><strong>Judgment:</strong> “bad/wrong emotion” → “emotion as a signal”.</li>\n  <li><strong>Overgeneralization:</strong> “I always…” → come back to this specific episode and its facts.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ignoring the body:</strong> add 2 bodily markers to every emotion you name.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> accuracy matters more than speed. \nIt’s better to name one emotion correctly than five “at random”. \nOver time you’ll have more words — and lighter reactions.</p>"

        "fullInfo": "<h2>🔄 Skill “Opposite Action”</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Opposite action</strong> is the DBT skill of intentionally changing emotions through behavior. It is based on the idea that emotions and actions are interconnected: <em>when you change your action, the emotion gradually changes as well.</em></p>\n\n<p>When an emotion <strong>does not fit the facts</strong> or is <strong>too intense</strong> for the situation, behavior opposite to its impulse helps restore balance.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🎯 Why this skill is useful</h3>\n\n<p>Emotions “urge” us to act: fear – to avoid, anger – to attack, sadness – to withdraw, shame – to hide. But if the situation does not actually support the emotion, following the impulse only increases suffering.</p>\n\n<p>DBT offers an alternative: <strong>do not wait for the emotion to go away – act opposite to it right now</strong>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>By changing your actions, you send your brain the signal: “the danger is over”.</li>\n  <li>Behavior becomes a source of new emotions – calm, confidence, interest.</li>\n  <li>You learn to influence feelings through choice, not through harsh control.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧩 When to use it</h3>\n\n<p>The skill is used when:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The facts <strong>do not support</strong> the emotion (you checked this with “Checking the Facts”).</li>\n  <li>The emotion is justified, but its intensity is excessive and prevents effective action.</li>\n  <li>The emotional impulse leads to <strong>self-destruction or isolation</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Example:</em> you are scared to go to a meeting, but there is no actual threat → you go anyway, despite the fear. This teaches your brain: “I can handle it.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>⚙️ How the skill works</h3>\n\n<p>Emotions are linked with the body, thoughts, and actions. By changing one link (behavior), you influence the entire chain. Bottom-up physiological and neural feedback reduces the intensity of the emotion.</p>\n\n<p><em>Example:</em> if you are angry but instead of attacking you speak calmly, the level of adrenaline drops and your wise mind becomes more available.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🪞 Basic steps</h3>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>1. Notice the emotion.</strong> Name it directly: “I am angry / anxious / ashamed / sad.”</li>\n  <li><strong>2. Identify the action urge.</strong> What do you feel like doing? (leaving, yelling, hiding, freezing?)</li>\n  <li><strong>3. Check the facts.</strong> Does the situation really justify this emotion?</li>\n  <li><strong>4. If not – choose the opposite action.</strong> Do the reverse of the urge: stay, approach, speak, smile, take part.</li>\n  <li><strong>5. Repeat until the emotion goes down.</strong> Opposite action works through repetition, not instantly.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> opposite action does not mean “pretending”, “forcing yourself”, or “being positive”. It means <em>behaving as if the emotion were weaker</em>, and letting the body catch up with the wise mind.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧠 Examples for basic emotions (DBT)</h3>\n\n<h4>🟥 Anger</h4>\n<p><strong>Urge:</strong> to attack, retaliate, blame, yell.<br>\n<strong>Opposite action:</strong> step back, speak calmly, listen, show goodwill.<br>\n<strong>Example:</strong> instead of shouting, take a deep breath and say: “I need to explain what I feel.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🟦 Fear / Anxiety</h4>\n<p><strong>Urge:</strong> to avoid, postpone, run away, defend yourself.<br>\n<strong>Opposite action:</strong> approach, stay, take a step forward, make eye contact, act despite the anxiety.<br>\n<strong>Example:</strong> you are scared to call – make the call even if your heart is pounding.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🟨 Sadness</h4>\n<p><strong>Urge:</strong> to isolate, stop doing important things, “freeze”.<br>\n<strong>Opposite action:</strong> engage in activity, move, connect with others, care for your body, seek support.<br>\n<strong>Example:</strong> you feel down – go outside, call a friend, put on music, do something pleasant.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🟪 Shame</h4>\n<p><strong>Urge:</strong> to hide, avoid contact, avoid eye contact, stay silent.<br>\n<strong>Opposite action:</strong> look people in the eye, speak openly, stand upright, remain in the situation.<br>\n<strong>Example:</strong> you feel ashamed about a mistake – still go to the meeting and stay engaged.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>⬛ Guilt</h4>\n<p><strong>Urge:</strong> to withdraw, punish yourself, avoid conversation, get stuck in self-blame.<br>\n<strong>Opposite action:</strong> admit the mistake, apologize, repair, act instead of ruminating.<br>\n<strong>Example:</strong> you let a colleague down – say directly: “I was wrong. I’m sorry. How can I make it right?”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🟩 Disgust</h4>\n<p><strong>Urge:</strong> to turn away, avoid, shut down.<br>\n<strong>Opposite action:</strong> look, move closer, stay present.<br>\n<strong>Example:</strong> if disgust is triggered by a difficult but safe topic – stay and keep listening.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 How to know opposite action is working</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The emotion becomes weaker or less demanding.</li>\n  <li>Your thinking becomes clearer.</li>\n  <li>Your body relaxes, breathing becomes more even.</li>\n  <li>You feel more in control.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>⚠️ When the skill is not appropriate</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>If the emotion <strong>fits the facts</strong> – use “Problem Solving”, not opposite action.</li>\n  <li>If you are extremely depleted and PLEASE factors are off – first take care of your body.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧘 Physiology of opposite action</h3>\n\n<p>Behavior influences the brain just like emotions do:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Calm, deliberate action activates the prefrontal cortex.</li>\n  <li>Approaching reduces amygdala activation.</li>\n  <li>Half-smile and relaxed posture activate the vagus nerve.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>DBT idea:</strong> sometimes you cannot “think” yourself into calm, but you can <em>act</em> yourself into calm.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Opposite action is not about “violence against yourself”, it is about <em>flexibility</em>.

Break goals into doable steps</h4>\n<p>Big goals can feel overwhelming.  \nBreak them into short actions that can be done in a day or a week.</p>\n\n<p><em>Example:</em>  \nGoal – “develop creative expression”.  \n→ Step 1: choose a medium.  \n→ Step 2: set aside 15 minutes to practice.  \n→ Step 3: share the result with someone.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🔹 Step 4.

It is systematic mental hygiene, just like sleep, food, and breathing.  \nJoy is also a skill – and it can be trained.</p>"

Each day is one step toward greater confidence.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>3️⃣ DBT formula: “Mastery = Small Wins + Mindfulness + Repetition”</h3>\n\n<p>Frequently performing small, achievable actions creates a neural habit of <strong>feeling competent</strong> even in difficult conditions.</p>\n\n<p>This formula works with depression, anxiety, and burnout.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>4️⃣ Exercise “Mini-steps”</h3>\n\n<p>Choose one task that feels difficult and break it into tiny steps.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Big goal</th><th>Mini-steps</th></tr>\n  <tr><td>Write a report</td><td>Open the file → write the title → outline the structure → fill in one section</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Clean up</td><td>Gather clothes → wipe the table → throw away 3 items</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Get back to exercise</td><td>Put on sneakers → go outside → walk for 10 minutes</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> if you cannot do “everything”, do “at least something”. That already counts as mastery.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>5️⃣ Practice “Plan for the day”</h3>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the day, fill in three points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>📌 <strong>Today I will do</strong>: one simple action that will strengthen my sense of control.</li>\n  <li>💬 <strong>Why it matters</strong>: one sentence about its meaning (“so I don’t get stuck”, “so I feel that I’m living”).</li>\n  <li>✅ <strong>Afterwards I will note success</strong>: “I did it.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can write this in a note app or on paper.  \nThe focus is not on “what to do”, but on <strong>noticing that you are taking action</strong>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6️⃣ “Mastery for a week” table</h3>\n\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Day</th><th>Small action</th><th>How I feel afterwards</th></tr>\n  <tr><td>Monday</td><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Thursday</td><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Friday</td><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Saturday</td><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Sunday</td><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>At the end of the week, read it through — this is proof that you are coping, even if your emotions say otherwise.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>7️⃣ Ideas for “small mastery” by state</h3>\n\n<h4>😶 When apathetic or depressed</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Take a shower.</li>\n  <li>Open the curtains.</li>\n  <li>Step out onto the balcony or outside for 2 minutes.</li>\n  <li>Drink a glass of water and notice the taste.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>😰 When anxious</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Write a to-do list instead of looping thoughts.</li>\n  <li>Do 5 minutes of 4–6 breathing.</li>\n  <li>Call someone you feel calm with.</li>\n  <li>Take one real action related to the source of anxiety.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>🔥 When burned out</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Set the task “do 1% of the goal”.</li>\n  <li>Split the day into short “work / rest” blocks.</li>\n  <li>Note that you are still moving — even if slowly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>8️⃣ Exercise “I did”</h3>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, take 2 minutes and write down everything you did — no matter how “important”.</p>\n\n<p>Examples:  \n“I got up”, “I ate”, “I made a call”, “I replied to an email”.</p>\n\n<p>Then add the sentence: <strong>“I managed, even if it was hard.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>This record is not about productivity — it is about <strong>noticing your strength</strong>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>9️⃣ Practice “Coping through repetition”</h3>\n\n<p>Choose one action you want to strengthen as a skill, and repeat it every day for 7 days in a row.</p>\n\n<p><em>Example:</em>  \n- Write for 10 minutes every day,  \n- Play an instrument for 5 minutes,  \n- Once a day respond to one difficult message.</p>\n\n<p>Do not set a goal to “improve” — simply <strong>maintain consistency</strong>.  \nMastery is born not from brilliance, but from repetition.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🔟 Checking effectiveness (DBT-style)</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Has the feeling of helplessness decreased at least a little (by 1–2 points)?</li>\n  <li>Has a sense of control or satisfaction appeared?</li>\n  <li>If yes — mastery is working.  \n  If not — choose an even simpler action and try again tomorrow.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Real mastery is not about being the best,  \nbut about <em>not stopping when it’s hard</em>.  \nEach small action proves: you are moving, which means you are already stronger than you were yesterday.</p>"

Define the situation.</strong><br>\n  Describe specifically: where, when, and with whom a difficult moment may occur.<br>\n  <em>Example:</em> “A conversation with my boss about a raise”, “a family gathering where there will be tension”.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>2. Define which emotions and difficulties may arise.</strong><br>\n  What exactly will be hard? Fear, shame, anger, guilt? What thoughts usually come up?  \n  <em>Example:</em> “I might go on the defensive”, “I might cry”, “I might freeze and go silent”.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>3. Define which skills you will need.</strong><br>\n  From all DBT tools, choose the ones that will help in this situation:  \n  <ul>\n    <li>🧘 Mindfulness (stay in the moment, notice your breath)</li>\n    <li>🪞 Effectiveness (focus on the goal, not the emotions)</li>\n    <li>💬 Interpersonal effectiveness (use DEAR MAN or GIVE)</li>\n    <li>💦 Self-soothing (use the 5 senses afterwards)</li>\n  </ul></li>\n\n  <li><strong>4. Mentally “live through” the situation step by step.</strong><br>\n  Picture yourself in the scene:  \n  <ul>\n    <li>How you enter the space, breathe, hold your posture.</li>\n    <li>How you speak, what words you choose.</li>\n    <li>How you notice emotions and use your skills.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Imagine the difficult moment and <em>see yourself coping</em>.</p></li>\n\n  <li><strong>5. End the rehearsal with self-support.</strong><br>\n  After the visualization, say to yourself:  \n  <em>“I am ready. I already know how to act. I can handle this.”</em>  \n  Take a couple of deep breaths and feel confidence in your body.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 Example DBT scenario</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Situation:</strong> a difficult conversation with a partner.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Emotions: anxiety, fear, anger.</li>\n  <li>Skills: STOP, 4–6 breathing, DEAR MAN.</li>\n  <li>Visualization: I see myself sitting calmly, speaking gently, breathing, listening.  \n  I notice my pulse, release tension, and say: “It’s important for me that we understand each other.”</li>\n  <li>Ending: internally I tell myself, “I can tolerate this conversation and stay respectful.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧘 Example for anxiety-provoking situations</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Situation:</strong> an upcoming presentation or exam.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Identify anxious thoughts (“I will make a mistake”, “Everyone will be watching”).</li>\n  <li>Notice physical sensations (trembling, fast breathing).</li>\n  <li>Imagine standing confidently, breathing deeply, speaking calmly.</li>\n  <li>Picture the presentation going well and feeling satisfied afterwards.</li>\n  <li>After the “rehearsal”, take one real exhale and say: “I am already prepared.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧩 Example for conflict situations</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Situation:</strong> talking with a relative who often criticizes you.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Imagine hearing the criticism and noticing irritation.</li>\n  <li>Remember the Nonjudgmental Stance: notice the words, not labels.</li>\n  <li>Breathe, soften your face, hold your posture.</li>\n  <li>Imagine calmly saying: “Thank you, I’ll think about that.”</li>\n  <li>Afterwards, internally note: “I kept respect for myself and for the other person.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧭 After the rehearsal</h3>\n\n<p>Write down 1–2 thoughts or sensations:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>What helped you feel calm?</li>\n  <li>What could you do differently?</li>\n  <li>How does your body feel now (softer, warmer, more even)?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This way, the Cope Ahead skill becomes <em>experience</em>, not just a “mental exercise”.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧠 Why it is effective</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Creates a sense of control over the situation.</li>\n  <li>Reduces physiological anxiety — the body already “knows” what to do.</li>\n  <li>Forms emotional readiness and confidence.</li>\n  <li>Helps you act from Wise Mind rather than panic.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Rehearse not only difficult situations, but also your strengths.  \nThat way, the brain remembers not only “what is scary”, but also “how I can cope”.</p>",

    "fullInfo": "<h2>💬 Skill “DEAR: Asking and asserting without conflict”</h2>\n\n<p><strong>DEAR</strong> is a structured DBT skill that helps you ask, negotiate, or set boundaries while staying respectful both to yourself and to the other person.  \nIt is used when you want to <strong>get something that matters to you</strong> without destroying the relationship or losing self-respect.</p>\n\n<p>The abbreviation <strong>DEAR</strong> stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>D — Describe</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>E — Express</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>A — Assert</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>R — Reinforce</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🎯 Purpose of the skill</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Learn to express your needs clearly and calmly.</li>\n  <li>Ask for what you need without guilt or aggression.</li>\n  <li>Increase the chances of being heard and understood.</li>\n  <li>Build relationships where respect is mutual.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>DBT says: <strong>“If you don’t ask, the answer is always ‘no’.”</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧩 When to use DEAR</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>When you need to ask someone for something important (at work, in family, in relationships).</li>\n  <li>When you need to say “no” without cutting off contact.</li>\n  <li>When you feel you’re not being heard and want to clarify your boundaries.</li>\n  <li>When you want to improve communication without conflicts and resentment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🪞 Detailed breakdown of the DEAR skill</h3>\n\n<h4>🔹 D — Describe (Describe the situation)</h4>\n\n<p>Start with a <strong>clean description of the facts</strong>, without interpretations, accusations, or labels.  \nSpeak so that the other person understands <em>what exactly happened</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Formula:</strong>  \n<em>“When [you describe the behavior or situation]…”</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong>  \n“When you don’t reply to my messages for several days…”  \n“When the meeting starts half an hour late…”</p>\n\n<p>Avoid words like “always”, “never”, “constantly” — they provoke defensiveness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🔹 E — Express (Express feelings and opinions)</h4>\n\n<p>Name your feelings and explain why this situation matters to you.  \nThis makes the conversation real and lowers the risk of misunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Formula:</strong>  \n<em>“…I feel [emotion], because [reason].”</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong>  \n“…I feel anxious because I don’t understand whether everything is okay.”  \n“…I feel angry because it’s important to me that agreements are kept.”</p>\n\n<p>Speak <strong>from yourself</strong>, without blaming: “I feel”, not “you make me feel”.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🔹 A — Assert (State your position or request)</h4>\n\n<p>Now say directly <strong>what you want or don’t want</strong>.  \nThis is the central part of DEAR.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Formula:</strong>  \n<em>“I need / I’m asking / I would like…”</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong>  \n“I’m asking that we agree on the time in advance.”  \n“I need you to let me know if plans change.”  \n“I’d like us to discuss this together.”</p>\n\n<p>If you are refusing — do it calmly:  \n<em>“I won’t be able to help with this because I don’t have the resources right now.”</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🔹 R — Reinforce (Reinforce with a positive outcome)</h4>\n\n<p>Explain <strong>why fulfilling the request is helpful</strong> — for both of you.  \nThis motivates the other person and turns the interaction into cooperation, not a power struggle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Formula:</strong>  \n<em>“If we do it this way, it will help…”</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong>  \n“…this will help me feel calmer and work more effectively.”  \n“…then I’ll be able to trust you more and talk about difficult topics more easily.”</p>\n\n<p>Reinforcement is not manipulation — it’s a way to show mutual benefit.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 Example of a full DEAR statement</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Situation:</strong> your colleague often comes late to meetings.</p>\n\n<p><em>“When you arrive after the meeting has already started (Describe),  \nI feel irritated because we lose time (Express).  \nI’m asking you to come on time so that we can discuss everything within the scheduled slot (Assert).  \nIf we do this, it will help us work more calmly and efficiently (Reinforce).”</em></p>\n\n<p>Short, clear, to the point — without accusations or apologies.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧠 Why it works</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>You speak from <strong>Wise Mind</strong>, not from raw emotion.</li>\n  <li>DEAR reduces the chance of conflict because there is no attack in it.</li>\n  <li>You show respect — for yourself (through clarity) and for the other person (through calmness).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>🌀 Skipping “Describe” — starting straight from emotions and accusations.</li>\n  <li>🔥 Demanding instead of asking: “You must…” instead of “I need…”.</li>\n  <li>😶 Hiding your feelings — then the other person doesn’t understand why this matters.</li>\n  <li>🎭 Ignoring Reinforce — a request without explaining the benefit can feel like pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧩 How DEAR connects with other DBT skills</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>DEAR</strong> is part of the <strong>DEAR MAN</strong> skill, where MAN (Mindful, Appear confident, Negotiate) is about staying grounded and flexible in dialogue.</li>\n  <li>It is complemented by <strong>GIVE</strong> (politeness, interest, validation) and <strong>FAST</strong> (self-respect).</li>\n  <li>Together they form a full system of <strong>Interpersonal Effectiveness</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re unsure how to start the conversation — first write your DEAR on paper.  \nEven that is already a step toward clarity and self-respect.</p>",
    "fullPractice": "<h2>💬 Practices for the skill “DEAR”</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>DEAR</strong> skill helps you talk about your needs clearly, calmly, and without guilt.  \nIt builds confidence and respect — for yourself and for the other person.  \nThis practice is especially helpful before an important conversation where you want to be heard instead of “exploding” or shutting down.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>1️⃣ Practice “My DEAR script”</h3>\n\n<p>Before a conversation, fill in this template:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Letter</th><th>What to say</th><th>Example</th></tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><strong>D – Describe</strong><br><small>(Describe the facts)</small></td>\n    <td>When you… / In situations when…</td>\n    <td>“When you don’t reply to messages for several days…”</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><strong>E – Express</strong><br><small>(Express your feelings)</small></td>\n    <td>I feel… because…</td>\n    <td>“…I feel anxious because I don’t know if everything is okay.”</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><strong>A – Assert</strong><br><small>(State your request or position)</small></td>\n    <td>I need… / I’m asking… / I’d like…</td>\n    <td>“I’m asking you to let me know if you can’t reply.”</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><strong>R – Reinforce</strong><br><small>(Reinforce with mutual benefit)</small></td>\n    <td>If we do this… / This will help…</td>\n    <td>“If we do this, it will help me feel calmer and keep our communication easier.”</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>Read your text out loud — you will notice where you sound too harsh or, on the contrary, unsure.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>2️⃣ Practice “DEAR on paper”</h3>\n\n<p>If it feels scary to speak out — write your DEAR as a letter (you don’t have to send it).</p>\n\n<p><em>Example:</em></p>\n<p>“When you often cancel our plans (D),  \nI feel sad and disappointed (E),  \nI’m asking you to tell me in advance if plans change (A),  \nthis way we can keep our connection and respect (R).”</p>\n\n<p>Even just writing it helps you realize <strong>what exactly you want</strong> instead of a vague “just fix it somehow”.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>3️⃣ Practice “Mini-DEAR” for everyday situations</h3>\n\n<p>Practice the skill in small things: at a café, at work, in daily life.  \nFor example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“When the coffee is very cold (D), I feel disappointed (E), I’d like it warmed up (A), so I can really enjoy it (R).”</li>\n  <li>“When you play music very loudly (D), it’s hard for me to concentrate (E), I’m asking you to turn it down (A), then it’ll be more comfortable for everyone (R).”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The more you practice in simple situations, the easier it becomes in serious ones.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>4️⃣ Exercise “Spotting the missing step”</h3>\n\n<p>Think of recent conflicts and identify which DEAR step was missing:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>❌ <strong>D</strong> — no facts, just emotions (“You always…”).</li>\n  <li>❌ <strong>E</strong> — feelings were not expressed (“I don’t care.”).</li>\n  <li>❌ <strong>A</strong> — no clear request (“You should just know.”).</li>\n  <li>❌ <strong>R</strong> — no explanation of benefit (“You just have to.”).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Add the missing element — and notice how the tone of the conversation changes.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>5️⃣ Practice “DEAR with a mirror”</h3>\n\n<p>Stand in front of a mirror and say your DEAR script.  \nNotice:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>How your voice sounds — gentle or accusatory?</li>\n  <li>What your body does — tenses or stays open?</li>\n  <li>How you breathe?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Try speaking a bit more slowly, with pauses.  \nConfidence shows not in volume but in steady tone.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6️⃣ Exercise “Three versions of DEAR”</h3>\n\n<p>Create three versions of the same request:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Harsh</strong> (aggressive) — “You have to…!”</li>\n  <li><strong>Soft</strong> (passive) — “Well, okay, never mind if you don’t want

in DEAR”</h3>\n\n<p>When you prepare for a conversation:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Take 3 deep breaths — activate Wise Mind.</li>\n  <li>Place your feet firmly on the ground — feel support.</li>\n  <li>Relax your shoulders and jaw — your voice will be more natural.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Confidence often starts in the body, not in the wording.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>8️⃣ Training “DEAR for tough topics”</h3>\n\n<p>Draft DEAR scripts for situations that are usually hard for you:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Situation</th><th>DEAR example</th></tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Discussion with a manager</td>\n    <td>“When I get tasks without deadlines (D), I feel anxious (E), I’m asking you to clarify the due date (A), this will help me plan better (R).”</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Saying no to a loved one</td>\n    <td>“When you ask me to meet today (D), I feel exhausted (E), I won’t be able to now (A), if I rest, I’ll be more present tomorrow (R).”</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Asking for support</td>\n    <td>“When things are really hard for me (D), I feel lonely (E), I’m asking you to just be there without giving advice (A), this helps me feel connected (R).”</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>9️⃣ Practice “DEAR in conflict”</h3>\n\n<p>If the conversation heats up:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Pause and go back to the first step — “Describe the facts”.</li>\n  <li>Speak

Checking the effectiveness of DEAR</h3>\n\n<p>After the conversation, ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Was I able to speak calmly and clearly?</li>\n  <li>Did I feel respect for myself?</li>\n  <li>Did I have a sense that I was heard?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Even if the outcome wasn’t perfect, the fact that you spoke in DEAR format is already an act of interpersonal effectiveness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> DEAR is not a script, but a habit of speaking from clarity.  \nYou can be both gentle and firm at the same time — that is what respectful

    "fullPractice": "<h2>🧍‍♂️ Practices for the skill “MAN”</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>MAN</strong> skill helps you stay stable and confident during a conversation — especially when emotions are high.  \nIt turns “arguments” into conscious dialogue, where you keep your goal, your calm, and your self-respect.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>1️⃣ Practice “Focus on the goal” (Mindful)</h3>\n\n<p>Before the conversation, ask yourself three questions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>🧭 <strong>What do I want to get</strong> from this conversation?</li>\n  <li>💬 <strong>How do I want to feel</strong> afterwards?</li>\n  <li>🤝 <strong>What kind of relationship do I want to keep</strong> with this person?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Formulate a short intention phrase:  \n<em>“My goal is to state my point clearly and stay calm.”</em></p>\n\n<p>Repeat it to yourself before the conversation — it becomes a mental anchor you can return to when emotions rise.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>2️⃣ Exercise “STOP during the conversation”</h3>\n\n<p>If you feel you’re starting to defend, justify, or get angry:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>S – Stop</strong> — pause speaking for a moment.</li>\n  <li><strong>T – Take a step back</strong> — breathe in, relax your shoulders.</li>\n  <li><strong>O – Observe</strong> — note: “I’m getting angry now.”</li>\n  <li><strong>P – Proceed mindfully</strong> — return to your goal and continue more calmly.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This micro-skill helps you not to snap and not to lose effectiveness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>3️⃣ Practice “Soft gaze” (Mindful)</h3>\n\n<p>During the conversation, look at the other person not as an enemy, but as a partner in solving a problem.  \nA soft, steady gaze helps reduce tension for both of you.</p>\n\n<p>If the other person is irritated — don’t mirror that. Keep your tone calmer, as if you were helping the other person return to balance too.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>4️⃣ Practice “Body of confidence” (Appear Confident)</h3>\n\n<p>Before an important conversation, use a body anchor for confidence:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Place your feet firmly on the floor — feel the support.</li>\n  <li>Relax your shoulders and belly.</li>\n  <li>Straighten your back, keep your head level.</li>\n  <li>Take 3 slow breaths in and out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Say to yourself: <em>“I breathe, I’m here, I’m balanced.”</em></p>\n\n<p>This state is communicated through your nonverbal signals and creates a sense of inner strength, even if you’re nervous inside.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>5️⃣ Exercise “Voice of Wise Mind”</h3>\n\n<p>Try saying a phrase related to your request in three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>With an irritated tone (“You HAVE to listen to me!”)</li>\n  <li>With an insecure tone (“Sorry to bother you, but…”)</li>\n  <li>With a Wise Mind tone — calm, steady, without apologizing for your needs.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Choose the third option.  \nWise Mind doesn’t attack or plead — it simply states the truth calmly.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6️⃣ Practice “Confident phrases”</h3>\n\n<p>Use ready-made formulations that help you sound calm and grounded:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“I understand your point of view, and I’d also like to add…”</li>\n  <li>“It’s important to me that we talk about this so we can find a solution.”</li>\n  <li>“I’m not trying to argue — I want to clarify.”</li>\n  <li>“I appreciate that you’re talking about this with me.”</li>\n  <li>“If now isn’t a good time, let’s choose another moment.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These phrases create an atmosphere of confidence without pressure.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>7️⃣ Exercise “Flexibility and negotiation” (Negotiate)</h3>\n\n<p>Train your ability to find compromises:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Decide what is <strong>non-negotiable</strong> for you and where you can be flexible.</li>\n  <li>Listen to the other person’s position — not to necessarily agree, but to understand.</li>\n  <li>Offer alternatives:  \n  <em>“What if we try it this way?” / “Can I suggest another option?”</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>DBT teaches: <strong>Negotiation is not giving up — it’s collaboration.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>8️⃣ Practice “Three levels of stability”</h3>\n\n<p>During the conversation, periodically check three levels:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>🧠 <strong>Mind:</strong> What am I thinking right now? Am I in my goal or in self-defense?</li>\n  <li>💬 <strong>Speech:</strong> How does my voice sound — calm or tense?</li>\n  <li>🦶 <strong>Body:</strong> Am I grounded or completely tense?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This triple awareness brings you back to presence and makes the conversation more effective.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>9️⃣ Exercise “Compromise with respect”</h3>\n\n<p>When you see that the other person isn’t ready to agree:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Pause and say:  \n  <em>“It seems we see this differently. What would you need to consider my option?”</em></li>\n  <li>If you can’t reach an agreement now — suggest returning later:  \n  <em>“Let’s think about it and talk again tomorrow.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This way you don’t lose the connection, and you keep the door open.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🔟 Practice “Mindful reset after the conversation”</h3>\n\n<p>After a dialogue, do a short reset:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Take a deep breath in and out.</li>\n  <li>Note what you did well (for example, “I didn’t explode”, “I stayed in contact”).</li>\n  <li>If it was hard — don’t beat yourself up.  \n  Ask: “What can I improve next time?”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Every conversation is practice for resilience, not an exam.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 Example of MAN in action</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Situation:</strong> a colleague keeps interrupting you in meetings.</p>\n\n<p><em>\nM — (Mindful): “My goal is to calmly say that this is a problem for me.”<br>\nA — (Appear confident): “I sit straight, speak slowly, maintain eye contact.”<br>\nN — (Negotiate): “Could we agree to let each other finish before responding?”  \n</em></p>\n\n<p>This way you stay respectful but firm — this is DBT-style interpersonal effectiveness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The MAN skill is the ability to <em>stay in the center of the storm</em>.  \nWhen you are grounded, the conversation stops being a fight and becomes cooperation.</p>"

Let it be fully honest.</li>\n  <li>Create a playlist that reflects your inner “no”.</li>\n  <li>Make a photo or write a text that symbolizes your choice to be yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>💬 Verbal forms</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Say “no” where you used to agree out of fear.</li>\n  <li>Say out loud: “This format doesn’t work for me.”</li>\n  <li>Turn down something you don’t need, even if you fear judgment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>💪 Physical forms</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Change your posture, walk, or clothing style.</li>\n  <li>Do something physical that symbolizes freedom — dance, exercise, intentional breathing.</li>\n  <li>Change your routine: get up earlier, take a different route, do something “differently”.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>4️⃣ Practice “Inner Rebel Journal”</h3>\n\n<p>In DBT groups, this tool is used to “listen” to protest without judgment.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Take a notebook and start a dialogue with your inner rebel.</li>\n  <li>Write from that part’s perspective — freely, without censorship:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>“I’m sick of always having to be perfect.”  \n“I’m tired of adjusting to everyone.”  \n“I just want to be myself.”</em></p>\n\n<p>When the energy comes out onto the page, ask:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>What is this rebellion trying to protect?</li>\n  <li>How else can I take care of this?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The idea:</strong> you are not “silencing” the rebel — you are translating their language into conscious action.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>5️⃣ Exercise “My alternative act of freedom”</h3>\n\n<p>Choose one action that will show your independence but will not cause harm.  \nIt can be a symbolic step — small, but meaningful.</p>\n\n<p><em>Examples:</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Say “no” where you usually stay silent.</li>\n  <li>Do something “off schedule”: turn off your phone for a day, take a spontaneous trip.</li>\n  <li>Create something that reflects your inner voice — a text, an image, music.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The main point:</strong> it should be a <em>conscious “yes to yourself”</em>, not a “no to the whole world”.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6️⃣ Practice “A conversation with protest”</h3>\n\n<p>Close your eyes and imagine your inner protest as a part of you.  \nLook at it from the outside and ask:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What do you want for me?</li>\n  <li>What are you missing?</li>\n  <li>How can we work together?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Feel respect for this part — it is not a destroyer, it is a protector of your boundaries.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>7️⃣ Technique “Redirecting energy”</h3>\n\n<p>When you feel the urge to “do something radical”:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Pause (use the STOP skill).</li>\n  <li>Notice: “This is energy. It’s strong.”</li>\n  <li>Direct it into an action that strengthens you:\n    <ul>\n      <li>physical activity,</li>\n      <li>music,</li>\n      <li>cleaning or creating something new,</li>\n      <li>pouring it into a journal or drawing.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>The point:</strong> the power of protest remains — it simply starts working for you.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>8️⃣ Exercise “Against destruction — for life”</h3>\n\n<p>Fill in the table:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tr><th>What makes me angry / pressures me</th><th>How I usually react</th><th>How I can express this safely</th></tr>\n  <tr><td>Rules imposed on me</td><td>I shut down, stay silent, then explode</td><td>I speak calmly, write about it, change a habit</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Feeling controlled by others</td><td>I provoke, do things out of spite</td><td>I say “I want to decide for myself”, and choose my own way</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Sense of injustice</td><td>I withdraw and isolate</td><td>I write about it, start a project, look for allies</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>This table helps you see that you can live through protest in a useful way — without self-destruction.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>9️⃣ Practice “Quiet rebellion”</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes the best way to resist is simply to <strong>live in your own way</strong>, quietly and consistently.</p>\n\n<p>Set a personal rule that supports your freedom:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“I won’t apologize for what I feel.”</li>\n  <li>“I choose the path that matters to me.”</li>\n  <li>“I don’t have to be convenient for others.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Every time you follow this rule, you are performing an act of alternative rebellion.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 Reflection questions</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What rebels in me most often — my heart, body, or thoughts?</li>\n  <li>Which feelings stand behind my protest — anger, pain, fear, boredom?</li>\n  <li>How can I use this energy to create instead of destroy?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Alternative rebellion is not about “holding it in”.  \nIt is a mature way to say:  \n<em>“I am alive, I feel, I choose — and I do it with respect for myself.”</em></p>"

    "fullInfo": "<h2>💬 Skill “DEAR: Asking and asserting without conflict”</h2>\n\n<p><strong>DEAR</strong> is a structured DBT skill that helps you ask, negotiate, or set boundaries while staying respectful both to yourself and to the other person.  \nIt is used when you want to <strong>get something that matters to you</strong> without destroying the relationship or losing self-respect.</p>\n\n<p>The abbreviation <strong>DEAR</strong> stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>D — Describe</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>E — Express</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>A — Assert</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>R — Reinforce</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🎯 Purpose of the skill</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Learn to express your needs clearly and calmly.</li>\n  <li>Ask for what you need without guilt or aggression.</li>\n  <li>Increase the chances of being heard and understood.</li>\n  <li>Build relationships where respect is mutual.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>DBT says: <strong>“If you don’t ask, the answer is always ‘no’.”</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧩 When to use DEAR</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>When you need to ask someone for something important (at work, in family, in relationships).</li>\n  <li>When you need to say “no” without cutting off contact.</li>\n  <li>When you feel you’re not being heard and want to clarify your boundaries.</li>\n  <li>When you want to improve communication without conflicts and resentment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🪞 Detailed breakdown of the DEAR skill</h3>\n\n<h4>🔹 D — Describe (Describe the situation)</h4>\n\n<p>Start with a <strong>clean description of the facts</strong>, without interpretations, accusations, or labels.  \nSpeak so that the other person understands <em>what exactly happened</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Formula:</strong>  \n<em>“When [you describe the behavior or situation]…”</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong>  \n“When you don’t reply to my messages for several days…”  \n“When the meeting starts half an hour late…”</p>\n\n<p>Avoid words like “always”, “never”, “constantly” — they provoke defensiveness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🔹 E — Express (Express feelings and opinions)</h4>\n\n<p>Name your feelings and explain why this situation matters to you.  \nThis makes the conversation real and lowers the risk of misunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Formula:</strong>  \n<em>“…I feel [emotion], because [reason].”</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong>  \n“…I feel anxious because I don’t understand whether everything is okay.”  \n“…I feel angry because it’s important to me that agreements are kept.”</p>\n\n<p>Speak <strong>from yourself</strong>, without blaming: “I feel”, not “you make me feel”.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🔹 A — Assert (State your position or request)</h4>\n\n<p>Now say directly <strong>what you want or don’t want</strong>.  \nThis is the central part of DEAR.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Formula:</strong>  \n<em>“I need / I’m asking / I would like…”</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong>  \n“I’m asking that we agree on the time in advance.”  \n“I need you to let me know if plans change.”  \n“I’d like us to discuss this together.”</p>\n\n<p>If you are refusing — do it calmly:  \n<em>“I won’t be able to help with this because I don’t have the resources right now.”</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>🔹 R — Reinforce (Reinforce with a positive outcome)</h4>\n\n<p>Explain <strong>why fulfilling the request is helpful</strong> — for both of you.  \nThis motivates the other person and turns the interaction into cooperation, not a power struggle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Formula:</strong>  \n<em>“If we do it this way, it will help…”</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong>  \n“…this will help me feel calmer and work more effectively.”  \n“…then I’ll be able to trust you more and talk about difficult topics more easily.”</p>\n\n<p>Reinforcement is not manipulation — it’s a way to show mutual benefit.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 Example of a full DEAR statement</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Situation:</strong> your colleague often comes late to meetings.</p>\n\n<p><em>“When you arrive after the meeting has already started (Describe),  \nI feel irritated because we lose time (Express).  \nI’m asking you to come on time so that we can discuss everything within the scheduled slot (Assert).  \nIf we do this, it will help us work more calmly and efficiently (Reinforce).”</em></p>\n\n<p>Short, clear, to the point — without accusations or apologies.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧠 Why it works</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>You speak from <strong>Wise Mind</strong>, not from raw emotion.</li>\n  <li>DEAR reduces the chance of conflict because there is no attack in it.</li>\n  <li>You show respect — for yourself (through clarity) and for the other person (through calmness).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>🌀 Skipping “Describe” — starting straight from emotions and accusations.</li>\n  <li>🔥 Demanding instead of asking: “You must…” instead of “I need…”.</li>\n  <li>😶 Hiding your feelings — then the other person doesn’t understand why this matters.</li>\n  <li>🎭 Ignoring Reinforce — a request without explaining the benefit can feel like pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🧩 How DEAR connects with other DBT skills</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>DEAR</strong> is part of the <strong>DEAR MAN</strong> skill, where MAN (Mindful, Appear confident, Negotiate) is about staying grounded and flexible in dialogue.</li>\n  <li>It is complemented by <strong>GIVE</strong> (politeness, interest, validation) and <strong>FAST</strong> (self-respect).</li>\n  <li>Together they form a full system of <strong>Interpersonal Effectiveness</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re unsure how to start the conversation — first write your DEAR on paper.  \nEven that is already a step toward clarity and self-respect.</p>",
    "fullPractice": "<h2>💬 Practices for the skill “DEAR”</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>DEAR</strong> skill helps you talk about your needs clearly, calmly, and without guilt.  \nIt builds confidence and respect — for yourself and for the other person.  \nThis practice is especially helpful before an important conversation where you want to be heard instead of “exploding” or shutting down.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>1️⃣ Practice “My DEAR script”</h3>\n\n<p>Before a conversation, fill in this template:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Letter</th><th>What to say</th><th>Example</th></tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><strong>D – Describe</strong><br><small>(Describe the facts)</small></td>\n    <td>When you… / In situations when…</td>\n    <td>“When you don’t reply to messages for several days…”</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><strong>E – Express</strong><br><small>(Express your feelings)</small></td>\n    <td>I feel… because…</td>\n    <td>“…I feel anxious because I don’t know if everything is okay.”</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><strong>A – Assert</strong><br><small>(State your request or position)</small></td>\n    <td>I need… / I’m asking… / I’d like…</td>\n    <td>“I’m asking you to let me know if you can’t reply.”</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><strong>R – Reinforce</strong><br><small>(Reinforce with mutual benefit)</small></td>\n    <td>If we do this… / This will help…</td>\n    <td>“If we do this, it will help me feel calmer and keep our communication easier.”</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>Read your text out loud — you will notice where you sound too harsh or, on the contrary, unsure.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>2️⃣ Practice “DEAR on paper”</h3>\n\n<p>If it feels scary to speak out — write your DEAR as a letter (you don’t have to send it).</p>\n\n<p><em>Example:</em></p>\n<p>“When you often cancel our plans (D),  \nI feel sad and disappointed (E),  \nI’m asking you to tell me in advance if plans change (A),  \nthis way we can keep our connection and respect (R).”</p>\n\n<p>Even just writing it helps you realize <strong>what exactly you want</strong> instead of a vague “just fix it somehow”.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>3️⃣ Practice “Mini-DEAR” for everyday situations</h3>\n\n<p>Practice the skill in small things: at a café, at work, in daily life.  \nFor example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“When the coffee is very cold (D), I feel disappointed (E), I’d like it warmed up (A), so I can really enjoy it (R).”</li>\n  <li>“When you play music very loudly (D), it’s hard for me to concentrate (E), I’m asking you to turn it down (A), then it’ll be more comfortable for everyone (R).”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The more you practice in simple situations, the easier it becomes in serious ones.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>4️⃣ Exercise “Spotting the missing step”</h3>\n\n<p>Think of recent conflicts and identify which DEAR step was missing:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>❌ <strong>D</strong> — no facts, just emotions (“You always…”).</li>\n  <li>❌ <strong>E</strong> — feelings were not expressed (“I don’t care.”).</li>\n  <li>❌ <strong>A</strong> — no clear request (“You should just know.”).</li>\n  <li>❌ <strong>R</strong> — no explanation of benefit (“You just have to.”).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Add the missing element — and notice how the tone of the conversation changes.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>5️⃣ Practice “DEAR with a mirror”</h3>\n\n<p>Stand in front of a mirror and say your DEAR script.  \nNotice:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>How your voice sounds — gentle or accusatory?</li>\n  <li>What your body does — tenses or stays open?</li>\n  <li>How you breathe?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Try speaking a bit more slowly, with pauses.  \nConfidence shows not in volume but in steady tone.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6️⃣ Exercise “Three versions of DEAR”</h3>\n\n<p>Create three versions of the same request:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Harsh</strong> (aggressive) — “You have to…!”</li>\n  <li><strong>Soft</strong> (passive) — “Well, okay, never mind if you don’t want to…”</li>\n  <li><strong>Confident</strong> (DEAR) — “It’s important to me that…”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Feel the difference: DEAR gives you strength without pressure.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>7️⃣ Practice “Body in DEAR”</h3>\n\n<p>When you prepare for a conversation:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Take 3 deep breaths — activate Wise Mind.</li>\n  <li>Place your feet firmly on the ground — feel support.</li>\n  <li>Relax your shoulders and jaw — your voice will be more natural.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Confidence often starts in the body, not in the wording.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>8️⃣ Training “DEAR for tough topics”</h3>\n\n<p>Draft DEAR scripts for situations that are usually hard for you:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Situation</th><th>DEAR example</th></tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Discussion with a manager</td>\n    <td>“When I get tasks without deadlines (D), I feel anxious (E), I’m asking you to clarify the due date (A), this will help me plan better (R).”</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Saying no to a loved one</td>\n    <td>“When you ask me to meet today (D), I feel exhausted (E), I won’t be able to now (A), if I rest, I’ll be more present tomorrow (R).”</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Asking for support</td>\n    <td>“When things are really hard for me (D), I feel lonely (E), I’m asking you to just be there without giving advice (A), this helps me feel connected (R).”</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>9️⃣ Practice “DEAR in conflict”</h3>\n\n<p>If the conversation heats up:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Pause and go back to the first step — “Describe the facts”.</li>\n  <li>Speak more slowly, calmly, and concretely.</li>\n  <li>Use a phrase like:  \n  <em>“I don’t want us to fight, I want us to understand each other.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>DEAR helps you stay mindful even in difficult dialogues.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 Helpful phrases for DEAR</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“It’s important to me that…”</li>\n  <li>“I’d like us to try…”</li>\n  <li>“If we do it this way, it will help…”</li>\n  <li>“When … happens, I feel …”</li>\n  <li>“I understand your point of view, and at the same time I need…”</li>\n  <li>“I appreciate that you’re listening.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🔟 Checking the effectiveness of DEAR</h3>\n\n<p>After the conversation, ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Was I able to speak calmly and clearly?</li>\n  <li>Did I feel respect for myself?</li>\n  <li>Did I have a sense that I was heard?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Even if the outcome wasn’t perfect, the fact that you spoke in DEAR format is already an act of interpersonal effectiveness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> DEAR is not a script, but a habit of speaking from clarity.  \nYou can be both gentle and firm at the same time — that is what respectful strength looks like.</p>"

    "fullPractice": "<h2>🧍‍♂️ Practices for the skill “MAN”</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>MAN</strong> skill helps you stay stable and confident during a conversation — especially when emotions are high.  \nIt turns “arguments” into conscious dialogue, where you keep your goal, your calm, and your self-respect.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>1️⃣ Practice “Focus on the goal” (Mindful)</h3>\n\n<p>Before the conversation, ask yourself three questions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>🧭 <strong>What do I want to get</strong> from this conversation?</li>\n  <li>💬 <strong>How do I want to feel</strong> afterwards?</li>\n  <li>🤝 <strong>What kind of relationship do I want to keep</strong> with this person?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Formulate a short intention phrase:  \n<em>“My goal is to state my point clearly and stay calm.”</em></p>\n\n<p>Repeat it to yourself before the conversation — it becomes a mental anchor you can return to when emotions rise.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>2️⃣ Exercise “STOP during the conversation”</h3>\n\n<p>If you feel you’re starting to defend, justify, or get angry:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>S – Stop</strong> — pause speaking for a moment.</li>\n  <li><strong>T – Take a step back</strong> — breathe in, relax your shoulders.</li>\n  <li><strong>O – Observe</strong> — note: “I’m getting angry now.”</li>\n  <li><strong>P – Proceed mindfully</strong> — return to your goal and continue more calmly.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This micro-skill helps you not to snap and not to lose effectiveness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>3️⃣ Practice “Soft gaze” (Mindful)</h3>\n\n<p>During the conversation, look at the other person not as an enemy, but as a partner in solving a problem.  \nA soft, steady gaze helps reduce tension for both of you.</p>\n\n<p>If the other person is irritated — don’t mirror that. Keep your tone calmer, as if you were helping the other person return to balance too.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>4️⃣ Practice “Body of confidence” (Appear Confident)</h3>\n\n<p>Before an important conversation, use a body anchor for confidence:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Place your feet firmly on the floor — feel the support.</li>\n  <li>Relax your shoulders and belly.</li>\n  <li>Straighten your back, keep your head level.</li>\n  <li>Take 3 slow breaths in and out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Say to yourself: <em>“I breathe, I’m here, I’m balanced.”</em></p>\n\n<p>This state is communicated through your nonverbal signals and creates a sense of inner strength, even if you’re nervous inside.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>5️⃣ Exercise “Voice of Wise Mind”</h3>\n\n<p>Try saying a phrase related to your request in three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>With an irritated tone (“You HAVE to listen to me!”)</li>\n  <li>With an insecure tone (“Sorry to bother you, but…”)</li>\n  <li>With a Wise Mind tone — calm, steady, without apologizing for your needs.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Choose the third option.  \nWise Mind doesn’t attack or plead — it simply states the truth calmly.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6️⃣ Practice “Confident phrases”</h3>\n\n<p>Use ready-made formulations that help you sound calm and grounded:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“I understand your point of view, and I’d also like to add…”</li>\n  <li>“It’s important to me that we talk about this so we can find a solution.”</li>\n  <li>“I’m not trying to argue — I want to clarify.”</li>\n  <li>“I appreciate that you’re talking about this with me.”</li>\n  <li>“If now isn’t a good time, let’s choose another moment.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These phrases create an atmosphere of confidence without pressure.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>7️⃣ Exercise “Flexibility and negotiation” (Negotiate)</h3>\n\n<p>Train your ability to find compromises:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Decide what is <strong>non-negotiable</strong> for you and where you can be flexible.</li>\n  <li>Listen to the other person’s position — not to necessarily agree, but to understand.</li>\n  <li>Offer alternatives:  \n  <em>“What if we try it this way?” / “Can I suggest another option?”</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>DBT teaches: <strong>Negotiation is not giving up — it’s collaboration.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>8️⃣ Practice “Three levels of stability”</h3>\n\n<p>During the conversation, periodically check three levels:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>🧠 <strong>Mind:</strong> What am I thinking right now? Am I in my goal or in self-defense?</li>\n  <li>💬 <strong>Speech:</strong> How does my voice sound — calm or tense?</li>\n  <li>🦶 <strong>Body:</strong> Am I grounded or completely tense?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This triple awareness brings you back to presence and makes the conversation more effective.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>9️⃣ Exercise “Compromise with respect”</h3>\n\n<p>When you see that the other person isn’t ready to agree:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Pause and say:  \n  <em>“It seems we see this differently. What would you need to consider my option?”</em></li>\n  <li>If you can’t reach an agreement now — suggest returning later:  \n  <em>“Let’s think about it and talk again tomorrow.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This way you don’t lose the connection, and you keep the door open.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🔟 Practice “Mindful reset after the conversation”</h3>\n\n<p>After a dialogue, do a short reset:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Take a deep breath in and out.</li>\n  <li>Note what you did well (for example, “I didn’t explode”, “I stayed in contact”).</li>\n  <li>If it was hard — don’t beat yourself up.  \n  Ask: “What can I improve next time?”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Every conversation is practice for resilience, not an exam.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>💬 Example of MAN in action</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Situation:</strong> a colleague keeps interrupting you in meetings.</p>\n\n<p><em>\nM — (Mindful): “My goal is to calmly say that this is a problem for me.”<br>\nA — (Appear confident): “I sit straight, speak slowly, maintain eye contact.”<br>\nN — (Negotiate): “Could we agree to let each other finish before responding?”  \n</em></p>\n\n<p>This way you stay respectful but firm — this is DBT-style interpersonal effectiveness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The MAN skill is the ability to <em>stay in the center of the storm</em>.  \nWhen you are grounded, the conversation stops being a fight and becomes cooperation.</p>"

    "fullPractice": "<h2>🤝 Practices for the skill “GIVE”</h2>\n\n<p>GIVE practices help you train gentleness, interest, validation, and lightness in real conversations — first in simple situations, then in more difficult ones.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>1️⃣ Practice “GIVE script” before a conversation</h3>\n\n<p>Before an important dialogue, fill in a mini-template:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Element</th><th>What I can do</th></tr>\n  <tr><td><strong>G — Gentle</strong></td><td>How can I speak gently?

Formulate a phrase like: <em>“I understand this is important to you, and at the same time I also have boundaries.”</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>3️⃣ “Stop apologizing” (no Apologies)</h3>\n<p>Notice automatic “sorry” when you ask for something or set a boundary.

Attentive listening.</strong> Being fully present, not interrupting.</li>\n  <li><strong>2. Reflection.</strong> “If I understand you right, you feel…”</li>\n  <li><strong>3.

    "fullPractice": "<h2>💬 Practices for the skill “Validation”</h2>\n\n<p>These practices help you learn to acknowledge another person’s feelings sincerely, without invalidating and without trying to rescue or fix them.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>1️⃣ Practice “Stop arguing — validate first”</h3>\n<p>In any difficult situation, try not to start with arguments, but with acknowledging emotions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“I can see this is hard for you.”</li>\n  <li>“I understand why you react this way.”</li>\n  <li>“That really could be hurtful.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notice how the tone of the conversation changes.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>2️⃣ Exercise “Listening without interrupting”</h3>\n<p>Choose one dialogue and set a goal: just listen for 1–2 minutes without comments, explanations, or advice. Only attention and presence.</p>\n<p>This simple practice trains respect and emotional patience.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>3️⃣ Practice reflection</h3>\n<p>Repeat the key feeling in your own words:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“You’re upset because you were counting on something different.”</li>\n  <li>“You felt scared when that happened.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This shows: “I understand you” — without arguing.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>4️⃣ Exercise “Reading nonverbal cues”</h3>\n<p>Try to notice posture, voice, speech tempo, and gaze. Sometimes the body says more about a person’s state than their words do.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>5️⃣ Practice normalizing</h3>\n<p>Add a phrase that reduces shame:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“Anyone would feel that way.”</li>\n  <li>“This is a natural reaction.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>6️⃣ Exercise “Warm presence”</h3>\n<p>When someone is struggling: breathe calmly, keep your voice soft, don’t look away. Your state becomes their support.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>7️⃣ Practice “It’s not about me”</h3>\n<p>If you want to respond with: “That happened to me too…” — pause. Ask yourself: “Will this help them, or is this about me?”</p>\n<p>If it’s about you — go back to validation.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>8️⃣ Exercise “Validation phrases”</h3>\n<p>Try using one of these:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“Thank you for sharing this with me.”</li>\n  <li>“What you feel makes sense.”</li>\n  <li>“It sounds like that was really unpleasant.”</li>\n  <li>“You’re not alone in this.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>9️⃣ Practice “Tough conversation”</h3>\n<p>Choose a conflict situation and write a short script where the first thing you say is validation. For example:</p>\n<p><em>“I can see that you’re angry, and that matters. Let’s try to calmly talk about what happened.”</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>🔟 Reflection after communication</h3>\n<p>Ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Was I able to notice the other person’s emotions?</li>\n  <li>Was I sincere?</li>\n  <li>What changed after I validated their feelings?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Real validation = attention + warmth + no arguing. It’s the foundation of safe relationships.</p>"
