    "usageGuideTitle1": "How Wisemind actually helps",
    "usageGuideBody1": "Wisemind isn’t magic and it’s not about tracking everything just for the sake of it.\n\nThe free version already has everything you need to start changing your behavior: logging your state, breaking down difficult situations and trying new ways to respond.\n\nChange takes effort: the app can’t do the work for you, but it can support you step by step.",

    "usageGuideTitle2": "Step 1. Notice what is happening to you",
    "usageGuideBody2": "You can’t change your behavior if you don’t notice what’s going on with you.\n\nThat’s why the first skills block — Mindfulness — is available for free. It helps you pay attention to:\n• your body and sensations\n• your thoughts and emotions\n• what is happening around you\n\nThis makes it easier to catch the moment when a lapse usually starts.",

    "usageGuideTitle3": "Step 2. Define your problem behavior",
    "usageGuideBody3": "First be honest about what is a problem for you: alcohol, fights with loved ones, overeating, smoking, impulsive shopping and so on.\n\nThen fill in the Daily Card every evening. Over time you’ll see links between lack of sleep, stress, lack of rest and other triggers that push you towards lapses and your usual problem behavior.",

    "usageGuideTitle4": "Step 3. Analyse lapses and train skills",
    "usageGuideBody4": "Lapses are inevitable — they are not failure, but material to work with.\n\nUse worksheets to go step by step through what happened before, during and after an episode. DBT skills are grouped into four modules:\n• mindfulness\n• distress tolerance\n• emotion regulation\n• interpersonal effectiveness\n\nTake them slowly — we recommend one skill per week — and keep the ones that work best for you.",

    "usageGuideTitle5": "Ready to start?",
    "usageGuideBody5": "We’ll keep adding new tools, exercises and meditations to support you on your way.\n\nFor now, take the first step — fill in your first entry in the “My state” section.\n\nYou’ll answer a few simple questions about sleep, well-being and emotions. If you come back to it every day, a habit gradually forms — and habits change behavior over time.",

  "dbtFaq_q1_title": "Is DBT therapy or a set of skills?",
  "dbtFaq_q1_body": "<strong>Short:</strong>\nDBT is a structured therapeutic approach where skills training is a core part.\n\n<strong>More detail:</strong>\nDBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) grew out of CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). It includes psychotherapy (individual and/or group), a skills system, and ways to stay on course when things get hard.\n\n📌 This app covers the skills part: read, review, practice, and bring it into real life.",

  "dbtFaq_q2_title": "Who is it for / who is it not for?",
  "dbtFaq_q2_body": "✅ Good fit for:\n• people already in DBT/CBT who want practice \"between sessions\";\n• people with intense emotions → impulsive actions, conflicts, self-sabotage;\n• psychologists/therapists as an additional tool for clients.\n\n⚠️ May not be a good fit if:\n• you’re looking for a \"quick life hack\" instead of regular practice;\n• you’re in an acute crisis and need urgent help (people and emergency support matter more than an app);\n• you expect reading to replace therapy. The app is a tool, not a replacement.",

  "dbtFaq_q3_title": "How is DBT different from CBT?",
  "dbtFaq_q3_body": "<strong>Short:</strong>\nCBT focuses more on changing thoughts/behavior; DBT focuses on balancing acceptance and change + skills for emotion regulation.\n\n<strong>More detail:</strong>\nDBT came from CBT and keeps its logic, but adds a key layer: first stabilization (stress, impulses, relationships), then deeper change.\n\n📌 DBT is especially helpful when: \"I understand everything, but in the moment I get carried away.\"",

  "dbtFaq_q4_title": "What is dialectics?",
  "dbtFaq_q4_body": "<strong>Short:</strong>\nDialectics is the ability to hold two truths at the same time.\n\n<strong>More detail:</strong>\nFor example:\n• \"I feel terrible\" and \"I can cope\";\n• \"I accept myself\" and \"I want to change.\"\n\n📌 DBT keeps bringing you back to this balance: avoid extremes, look for a more accurate, workable position.",

  "dbtFaq_q5_title": "What is Wise Mind?",
  "dbtFaq_q5_body": "<strong>Short:</strong>\nWise Mind is the state where emotions and logic meet.\n\n<strong>More detail:</strong>\nThere’s:\n• Emotion Mind (impulsive reactions)\n• Reasonable Mind (dry logic)\n\n✨ Wise Mind isn’t \"being calm all the time\" — it’s making decisions that consider both feelings and facts.\n\n📌 In this app, it makes sense to start here.",

  "dbtFaq_q6_title": "What is the biosocial theory about?",
  "dbtFaq_q6_body": "<strong>Short:</strong>\nBiology and environment together shape emotional vulnerability.\n\n<strong>More detail:</strong>\nSome people have more sensitive nervous systems (they \"ignite\" faster and calm down slower).\nIf, on top of that, emotions weren’t validated in their environment — were shamed or punished — people often learn to survive through extremes:\n• explosions\n• avoidance\n• shutting down\n\n📌 DBT doesn’t blame; it offers skills to live with more stability.",

  "dbtFaq_q7_title": "Is there an evidence base?",
  "dbtFaq_q7_body": "<strong>Short:</strong>\nYes — DBT is one of the most researched approaches for emotion regulation.\n\n<strong>More detail:</strong>\nDBT was designed as a protocol with measurable goals and tested effectiveness. There are studies and meta-analyses, especially around:\n• suicidality / self-harm\n• borderline symptoms\n• addictive behavior\n• emotional instability\n\n⚠️ Important: \"evidence-based\" doesn’t mean \"just know it\" — you still have to practice the skills.",

  "dbtFaq_q8_title": "How long does it take to feel results?",
  "dbtFaq_q8_body": "<strong>Short:</strong>\nEarly changes are often noticeable after 2–4 weeks of practice; lasting change takes months.\n\n<strong>More detail:</strong>\nThis isn’t a motivation marathon — it’s training.\n• Some effects show up quickly (e.g., STOP/TIP in crisis).\n• Others take longer (emotion regulation, relationships).\n\n✅ A key progress marker: you still feel things, but you destroy yourself and your relationships less often.",

  "dbtFaq_q9_title": "How do you learn the skills effectively?",
  "dbtFaq_q9_body": "<strong>Short:</strong>\nOne skill → in a real situation → repetition.\n\n<strong>More detail (a practical plan):</strong>\n1) Choose the module that fits your current need (\"what do I need right now?\").\n2) Pick one skill and stick with it for 5–7 days.\n3) Practice in the moment + practice ahead of time when you’re calm.\n4) Track what worked / didn’t work — without self-blame, like a researcher.\n\n📌 Knowledge without practice changes almost nothing.",

  "dbtFaq_q10_title": "What if I keep forgetting to practice?",
  "dbtFaq_q10_body": "<strong>Short:</strong>\nMake it easier and tie it to a trigger.\n\n<strong>More detail:</strong>\nNot \"an hour of meditation\", but 30–60 seconds of a skill — consistently. Triggers beat motivation:\n• after brushing your teeth → 3 breaths + name the emotion;\n• before replying in a chat → STOP;\n• after a conflict → a quick note: \"what happened / what I feel\".\n\n📌 The goal is to integrate the skill into life, not turn it into another chore.\n\n✅ Result: at first you spend some effort to learn the skill, and later you’ll use it automatically (not necessarily in writing). This helps you respond more consciously and make more balanced decisions that consider both facts and feelings.",

  "dbtFaq_q11_title": "Can I use it without a therapist?",
  "dbtFaq_q11_body": "<strong>Short:</strong>\nYes, as self-help — but it’s a limited format.\n\n<strong>More detail:</strong>\nSkills alone can be very useful: they reduce impulsivity and increase stability.\n\n⚠️ If you’re dealing with severe symptoms, self-harm, addictions, trauma, or major depression, outcomes are usually better with professional support.\n\n📌 The app can be great \"homework\", but it doesn’t replace therapy.",
