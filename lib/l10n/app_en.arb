    "usageGuideTitle1": "How Wisemind actually helps",
    "usageGuideBody1": "Wisemind isn’t magic and it’s not about tracking everything just for the sake of it.\n\nThe free version already has everything you need to start changing your behavior: logging your state, breaking down difficult situations and trying new ways to respond.\n\nChange takes effort: the app can’t do the work for you, but it can support you step by step.",

    "usageGuideTitle2": "Step 1. Notice what is happening to you",
    "usageGuideBody2": "You can’t change your behavior if you don’t notice what’s going on with you.\n\nThat’s why the first skills block — Mindfulness — is available for free. It helps you pay attention to:\n• your body and sensations\n• your thoughts and emotions\n• what is happening around you\n\nThis makes it easier to catch the moment when a lapse usually starts.",

    "usageGuideTitle3": "Step 2. Define your problem behavior",
    "usageGuideBody3": "First be honest about what is a problem for you: alcohol, fights with loved ones, overeating, smoking, impulsive shopping and so on.\n\nThen fill in the Daily Card every evening. Over time you’ll see links between lack of sleep, stress, lack of rest and other triggers that push you towards lapses and your usual problem behavior.",

    "usageGuideTitle4": "Step 3. Analyse lapses and train skills",
    "usageGuideBody4": "Lapses are inevitable — they are not failure, but material to work with.\n\nUse worksheets to go step by step through what happened before, during and after an episode. DBT skills are grouped into four modules:\n• mindfulness\n• distress tolerance\n• emotion regulation\n• interpersonal effectiveness\n\nTake them slowly — we recommend one skill per week — and keep the ones that work best for you.",

    "usageGuideTitle5": "Ready to start?",
    "usageGuideBody5": "We’ll keep adding new tools, exercises and meditations to support you on your way.\n\nFor now, take the first step — fill in your first entry in the “My state” section.\n\nYou’ll answer a few simple questions about sleep, well-being and emotions. If you come back to it every day, a habit gradually forms — and habits change behavior over time.",
